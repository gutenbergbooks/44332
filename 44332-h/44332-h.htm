<h2>THE YEAR OF REACTION.</h2>


<p>If the year 1848&mdash;"<small>THE YEAR OF
REVOLUTIONS</small>" was one pre-eminent
among all others for the magnitude
and interest of the events it brought
forth, the year which has just expired&mdash;<small>THE
YEAR OF REACTION</small>&mdash;is still
more worthy of serious reflection, and
affords subjects for more cheering
meditation. If the first exhibited
the whirlwind of anarchy let loose,
the second showed the power by
which it is restrained; if the former
filled every heart with dread at the
fierce passions which were developed,
and the portentous events which
occurred in the world, the latter
afforded reason for profound thankfulness,
at the silent but irresistible
force with which Omnipotence overrules
the wickedness of men, and restrains
the madness of the people.</p>

<p>The history of the world during
those periods of convulsion, happily
of very rare occurrence, when an
eruption of popular passions takes
place&mdash;when thrones are overturned,
and the long-established order of
things is subverted&mdash;is nothing else
but the folly and wickedness of man
warring against the wisdom of nature.
All history demonstrates that there is
a certain order of things which is
favourable to human felicity&mdash;under
which industry flourishes, population
increases, the arts are encouraged,
agriculture improves, general happiness
is diffused. The basis of such
a state of things is the <em>security of
property</em>; the moving power which
puts in motion the whole complicated
machine of society, is the certainty
that every man will enjoy the fruits
of his toil. As clearly do past events
demonstrate, that there is a state
of things wherein the reverse of all
this takes place; when industry is paralysed,
population arrested, the arts
languish, agriculture decays, general
misery prevails. The chief cause of
such a state of things is to be found
in the insecurity of property, the
dread that industry will not reap its
appointed reward; but that external
violence or domestic spoliation may
interfere between the labourer and
the fruits of his toil. When such a
state of things arises from internal
commotion, it is generally preceded
by the warmest hopes, and the most
unbounded anticipations of felicity.
It is universally characterised by a
resolute disregard of experience, and
a universal passion for innovation
in all the institutions of society, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
all the relations of life. It constantly
appeals to the generous affections:
speaks of humanity, justice, and fraternity;
proclaims mankind as brothers;
and professes the warmest
desire for general felicity, and the
diminution of the sources of human
suffering. It veils the advance of
selfishness under the guise of generosity.
Revolutions demonstrate that
the homage which vice pays to
virtue is not confined to individuals.
The maxim of Rochefoucault applies
also to nations. Its truth is never
seen with such brightness as during
the intensity of a revolution; and
this demonstrates at once the wisdom
which governs, and the selfishness
which desolates the world.</p>

<p>So prone, however, are the bulk of
mankind to delusion; so easily are
they led away by expressions which
appeal to their passions, or projects
which seem to forward their interests;
so little are the lessons of experience
either known to, or heeded by, the immense
majority of men, that we should
be led to despair of the fortunes of
the species, and dread in every age
a repetition of the seductive passions
which had desolated the one that
had preceded it, were it not that a
provision is made for the extinction
of popular passion in the very first
effects of its ebullition. It is in its
<em>effect upon property</em> that the curb is
found which restrains the madness of
the people; by the insolvency it induces
that the barrier is formed,
which as a matter of necessity forces
back society to its habitual forms and
relations. In the complicated state
of social relations in which we live,
it is by the capital of the rich that the
industry of the poor is put in motion;
by their expenditure that it is alimented.
However specious and alluring
the projects may be which are
brought forward by the popular leaders,
they involve in them one source
of weakness, which inevitably ere long
paralyses all their influence. Directly
or indirectly, they all tend to the destruction
of property. To excite the
passions of the working classes, they
are obliged to hold out to them the
prospect of a division of property, or
such a system of taxation as practically
amounts to the same thing:
the immediate effect of which is a
cessation of expenditure on the part
of the affluent classes; a hoarding of
capital; a run upon the banks for
specie; universal scarcity of money,
general distrust, and a fearful decrease
of employment. These evils
are first felt by the working classes,
because, having no stock, they are
affected by any diminution in their
daily wages; and they are felt with
the more bitterness that they immediately
succeed extravagant hopes,
and highly wrought expectations.
Invariably the effects of revolutions
are precisely the reverse of the predictions
of its supporters. No man is
insensible to his own suffering, however
much he may be so to that of
his predecessors; and thence the universal
and general reaction which,
sooner or later, takes place against
revolutions.</p>

<p>That this reaction would take
place to a certainty, in the end, with
the French revolution of 1848, as it
had done with all similar convulsions
since the beginning of the world, could
be doubted by none who had the least
historical information: and in our
first article on that event, within a
few weeks of its occurrence, we distinctly
foretold that this would be the
case.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> But we confess we did not
anticipate the <em>rapidity</em> with which the
reaction has set in. Not two years
have elapsed since the throne of Louis
Philippe was overturned, and a republic
proclaimed in Paris amidst the
transports of the revolutionary party
over all Europe, and the gaze in astonishment
of all the world; and already
the delusion is over, the transports
are at an end, the Jacobins are
silent, and the convulsed commonwealth
is fast sinking back to its
pristine monarchical form of government.
Every country in Europe felt
the shock. The passions were universally
let loose; sanguinary wars arose
on every side; and while the enlightened
Free-traders of England were
dreaming, amidst their cotton bales, of
universal and perpetual peace, which
should open to them the markets of
the world, hostilities the most terrible,
contests the most dreadful, dissensions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
the most implacable, broke
out in all quarters. It was not merely
the war of opinion which Mr Canning
long ago prophesied as the next which
would desolate Europe: to it was
superadded the still more frightful
contest of races. The Lombard rose
against the German, the Bohemian
against the Imperialist, the Hungarian
against the Austrian; the Celt and
the Saxon stood in arms against each
other. Naples was rent in twain; a
revolutionary state was established in
Sicily; the supreme pontiff was dethroned
at Rome; Piedmont joined
the innovating party; Lombardy rose
up against Austria, Bohemia was in
arms against Vienna, the Magyars
revived against the Germans the fierce
hostility of five centuries; Prussia
was revolutionised, Baden ravaged,
Denmark invaded; the Poles could
with difficulty be restrained amidst
the general effervescence; the Irish
openly made preparations for rebellion
and separation from Great Britain.
England itself was shaken: the
gravity and practical tendency of the
Anglo-Saxon character in part yielded
to the general contagion. London
was threatened with a revolutionary
movement; the Chartists in all the
manufacturing towns were prepared to
follow the example; treasonable
placards, calling on the people to rise,
were to be seen on all sides; and the
mighty conqueror who had struck
down Napoleon exerted his consummate
skill in baffling the rebellion of
his own countrymen, and won a victory
over anarchy not less momentous
than that of Waterloo, and not the
less memorable that it did not cost a
drop of human blood.</p>

<p>What a contrast, within the short
period of eighteen months, did Europe
afterwards exhibit! France, the
centre of impulsion to the civilised
world, was restrained; the demon of
anarchy was crushed in its birthplace;
the visions of the Socialists had been
extinguished in the blood of the
barricades. Dispersed, dejected, in
despair, the heroes of February were
languishing in exile, or mourning in
prison the blasting of their hopes, the
ruin of their prospects, the unveiling
of their sophistries. Revolution had
been crushed without the effusion of
blood in Berlin: law had regained its
ascendency; rebellion had quailed
before the undaunted aspect of the
defenders of order and the throne.
Naples had regained the dominion of
Sicily; the arms of France had restored
the Pope at Rome; the Eternal
City had yielded to the assault of
the soldiers of Louis Napoleon. Austria
had regained her ascendency in
Italy; the perfidious aggression of
Charles Albert had been signally
chastised by the skill and determination
of the veteran Radetsky; Milan
was again the seat of Imperial government;
the dream of a Venetian republic
had passed away, and the Place
of St Mark again beheld the double-headed
eagle of Austria at the summit
of its domes. Baden was conquered,
Saxony pacified; the fumes of revolutionary
aggression in Schleswig had
been dissipated by the firmness of
Denmark, and the ready, although
unexerted, support of Russia. Poland
was overawed by the Colossus of the
North; and even the heroic valour of
the Magyars, so often in happier days
the bulwark of the Cross, had yielded
to that loyalty and tenacity of purpose
which has so long distinguished the
Austrian people, joined and aided by
the support which, on this as on many
previous occasions, Russia has afforded
to the cause of order in Europe. Though
last, not least, Great Britain was
pacified: the dreams of the Socialists,
the treason of the Chartists, had recoiled
before the energy of a people
yet on the whole loyal and united.
Ireland, blasted by the triple curse of
rebellion, pestilence, and famine, had
ceased to be an object of disquietude
to England, save from the incessant
misery which it exhibited; and its
furious patriots, abandoning in multitudes
the land of their birth, were
carrying into Transatlantic regions
those principles of anarchy, and deathless
hatred at civilisation, which had
so long laid waste their own country.</p>

<p>Acknowledging, as all must do, with
devout thankfulness, that it is to the
Great Disposer of events that we are
to ascribe so marvellous a <small>DELIVERANCE
FROM EVIL</small>&mdash;so blessed an
escape from a fate which would have
renewed, in Europe, a devastation as
wide-spread, and darkness as thick,
as occurred during the middle ages&mdash;it
may yet, humanly speaking, be discerned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
how it is that our salvation
has been effected. The days of miracles
are past; the law is not now delivered
amidst the thunders of Mount
Sinai; the walls of fortresses do not
fall down at the sound of the Lord's
trumpet; there is no longer a chosen
people, over whose safety the eye of
Omnipotence watches, and whom, in
the last extremity, the destroying angel
rescues from their enemies. The direction
of human affairs by Supreme
Wisdom; the coercion of wickedness;
the support of virtue; the ceaseless
advance of the race of man, amidst all
the folly and selfishness with which its
concerns are conducted, have not, indeed,
passed away: all these are in as
complete operation now as when the
Red Sea opened to the retreating Israelites,
or the walls of Jericho fell before
the blast of Joshua's trumpet, or the
rending of the vail of the Temple announced
that the era had commenced
when the whole human race was to be
admitted to the sanctuary of the temple.
But it is by human means alone that
Providence now acts; it is by general
laws that the affairs of men are regulated.
The agents of Omnipotence
are the moving principles of the human
heart: the safeguards against ruin are
to be found in the barriers which, in
injured interests or counteracting passions,
are raised up amidst the agitated
multitude, against the further progress
of devastation. It is not from oblivion,
therefore, but with a constant recognition
of Divine superintendence, that
we shall now endeavour to trace out
the means by which the most alarming
moral pestilence which ever appeared
in modern times has been arrested;
the happiness of Europe saved, for the
time at least, from the destruction
by which it was menaced&mdash;from the
earthquake in its own bosom; and the
progress of real freedom throughout
the world prevented from being blasted
by the selfish ambition or insane delusions
of the demagogues who, for a
time, got possession of its current.</p>

<p>The first circumstance which must
strike every observer, in the contemplation
of the terrible crisis through
which we have passed, is, that the
destruction with which we were
threatened was mainly, if not entirely,
owing to <em>want of moral courage</em> on the
part of the depositaries of power.
The Revolution in Paris, it is well
known, owed its success entirely to
the pusillanimity of the <em>men</em> of the
royal family. Louis Philippe, old and
enfeebled by disease, was paralysed
by a still more fatal source of weakness&mdash;the
consciousness of a throne
won by treason&mdash;the terror inspired
by the sight of the barricades, behind
which his own government had been
constructed. His sons who were present
showed that the Orleans family
had lost, with the possession of a
usurped throne, the courage which, for
several generations, had constituted
the only virtue of their race. The
King of Prussia abandoned the contest
in Berlin in the moment of victory&mdash;a
nervous reluctance to the
shedding of blood paralysed, as it had
done in the days of Louis XVI., the
defenders of the throne. In Austria,
the known imbecility, physical and
moral, of the emperor, rendered him
wholly unequal to the crisis in which
he was placed&mdash;delivered over the
empire, undefended, to a set of revolutionary
murderers, and rendered a
change in the reigning sovereign indispensable.
In Rome, the Pope himself
began the movement&mdash;he first
headed the reform crusade; and whatever
his unhappy subjects have since
suffered is to be ascribed to his blind
delusion and weak concessions. Such
was the conduct of the kings of
Europe&mdash;such the front which our sex
in high places opposed to the revolutionary
tempest. But women often,
in the last extremity, exhibit a courage
which puts to shame the pusillanimity
of the men by whom they are surrounded;
and never was this more
signally evinced than in the present
instance. The Queen of France tried
in vain, at the Tuileries, to inspire her
husband with her own heroic spirit;
the Duchess of Orleans showed it in
front of levelled muskets in the
Chamber of Deputies; and, that order
is still preserved in our country, is to
be ascribed in no small degree to the
firm conduct of the sovereign on the
throne, and the determination with
which she inspired her government to
risk everything rather than concede
one iota to the revolutionists.</p>

<p>As it was the opposite conduct from
this, and the moral weakness of the
depositaries of power, which mainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
induced the revolutions of 1848, and
rendered them so formidable, so those
causes which have at length arrested
that terrible convulsion seem to have
been no other but the moral laws of
nature, destined for the correction of
wickedness and the coercion of passion,
when they have risen to such a
pitch as seriously to endanger the
existence of society. And, without
presuming to scan too deeply the intentions
of Providence, or the great
system by which evil is brought out
of good, and an irresistible power
says to the madness of the people, as
to the storms of the ocean, "Hitherto
shalt thou come, and no farther, and
here shall thy proud waves be staid,"
we may probably discover, humanly
speaking, the means by which the
evil has been arrested.</p>

<p>The first circumstance which has
produced the reaction, and arrested
the progress of evil so much more
rapidly than was the case in the former
great convulsion, is the memory of
that convulsion itself. It is no doubt
true, that every generation is taught
by its own and none by its predecessors'
sufferings; but, in the case of
the first French Revolution, the suffering
was so long-continued and
dreadful, that the memory of it descended
to the next generation. It
was impossible that the sons of the
men who had been guillotined, exiled,
or mown down by the conscription,
who had seen their estates and
honours torn from them by the ruthless
hand of Revolutionary violence,
should not retain a vivid sense of the
sufferings they had experienced, and
the wrongs they had undergone. All
classes, not excluding even those who
had been most ardent and active in support
of the first Revolution, had writhed
alike under the calamities and exactions
of the latter years of the war,
and the ignominious conquest in which
it had terminated, which was only
felt the more keenly from the unparalleled
triumphs to which the nation
had so long been habituated. Add to
this, that the attention of all the
intelligent classes of society in Europe
generally, and in France in particular,
had been long, and to an extent of
which in this country we can scarcely
form an idea, riveted on the events
of the first Revolution. The Reign
of Terror was not forgotten; the
prophecy of the historian<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> proved
true:&mdash;"A second French Revolution,
of the same character as the
former, and the age in which it is to
arise must be ignorant of the first."
Its heartstirring incidents, its mournful
catastrophes, its tragic events, its
heroic virtue, its appalling wickedness,
its streams of blood, were indelibly
engraven on the hearts of a
considerable, and that too the most
influential, part of the people. The
revolutionists, indeed, in every country&mdash;the
Red Republicans in France,
the Chartists in England, the Rebels
in Ireland, the Carbonari in Italy,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Illuminés</i> in Germany, were perfectly
prepared to renew for their
own profit the same scenes of spoliation,
bloodshed, and massacre. But
such extreme characters form, even in
the most depraved society, but a
small part of the whole inhabitants.
It is the delusion or timidity of the
great body, not the absolute strength
or numbers of the violent party,
which is the principal danger. The
force of the first Revolution consisted
in its novelty; in the enchantment of
its visions, the warmth of its professed
philanthropy, the magnitude of its promises.
But time had dispelled these,
as it does many other delusions. The
mask had fallen from the spectre
which had charmed the world, and
the awful form of <span class="smcap">Death</span> had appeared.</p>

<p>The second circumstance which
tended to coerce, more rapidly than
could have been hoped for, the progress
of the revolution of 1848, was
the firmness and loyalty of the soldiers.
It is historically known that it
was the defection of the troops which
brought on, and rendered irresistible
the march of the first Revolution:
which induced, in rapid succession,
the Reign of Terror, the assignats, the
conscription, the capture of Paris, the
subjugation of the kingdom. But
here, too, experience and suffering
came to the aid of deluded and wandering
humanity. It was seen that
what is unjust and dishonourable is
<em>never</em> expedient: that the violation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
their oaths by the sworn defenders of
order is not the commencement of the
regeneration, but the first step in the
decline of society: and that to fear
God and honour the king is the only
way to insure, not only the preservation
of order, but the ultimate ascendancy
of freedom. On the foundation
of the revolt of the Gardes Françaises
in 1789, were successively
built the despotism of the Committee
of Public Salvation, the blood of Robespierre,
the carnage of Napoleon. The
awful example was not lost on the
next generation. The throne of
Charles X. was overthrown by the
defection of the troops of the line;
but it was again found that the glorious
fabric of civil liberty was not to be
erected on the basis of treachery and
treason. None of the troops revolted
on the crisis of February 1848. The
Guards and the line were alike steady.
Marshal Bugeaud, when he received
the command, speedily passed the
whole barricades, and in six hours
would have extinguished the revolt.
The throne was lost not by the defection
of the troops, but by the pusillanimity
of the princes of the blood; and
accordingly, when the next contest
occurred&mdash;as occur it ever will in such
cases&mdash;the troops were resolutely led,
the revolution was put down under
circumstances ten times more formidable,
though not without a frightful
loss of human life.</p>

<p>We are so accustomed to the loyalty
and steadiness of the English army,
that the possibility of their wavering
never enters into our imagination.
But still all must admit that we too,
with all our boasted safeguards of
popular representation, general information,
a free press, and centuries of
freedom, stood on the edge of an
abyss; and that, not less than Austria
or Prussia, our salvation had come to
depend chiefly, if not entirely, on the
fidelity of the soldiers. If the six thousand
men who garrisoned London on
the 10th April 1848 had wavered, and
one-half of them had joined the insurgents,
where would now have been
the British constitution? Had a hundred
thousand men from Kennington
Common crossed Waterloo Bridge,
headed by a regiment of the Guards,
and three regiments of the line, where
would now have been the British
liberties? Where would have been
all the safeguards formed, all the hopes
expressed, all the prophecies hazarded,
as to its being perpetual? But in
that dread hour, perhaps the most
eventful that England ever knew, we
were saved by the courage of the
Queen, the firmness of the government,
the admirable arrangements of
the Duke of Wellington, and the universal
steadiness and loyalty of our
soldiers. We are quite aware of the
special constables, and the immense
<em>moral</em> influence of the noble display
which the aristocracy and middle
classes of England made on that occasion.
But moral influence, often all-powerful
in the end, is not alone
sufficient at the beginning; physical
force is then required to withstand the
<em>first assault</em> of the enemy: and, highly
as we respect the civic force with
batons in their hands; and fully as
we admit the immense importance of
that citizen-demonstration in its ultimate
effects, we ascribe our deliverance
from the instant peril which
threatened, entirely to the steadiness
of the British army, and the incomparable
arrangements of their chief.</p>

<p>In the Continental states, order succeeded
in regaining the ascendency
over anarchy entirely in consequence
of the fidelity of the soldiers. On
that memorable day, when the Prussian
army marched into Berlin playing
the old airs of <em>the monarchy</em>, and
formed in a circle around, distant
only twenty-five paces from the insurgent
host, and there tranquilly loaded
their pieces, the opposing forces were
directly brought into collision; it was
seen that, in a few seconds, law or
rebellion would be victorious. Law
prevailed, as it generally does where
its defenders are steady and resolutely
led&mdash;and what has been the result?
Is it that freedom has been extinguished
in Prussia, that liberty has
sunk under the pressure of tyrannic
power, and that a long period of servitude
and degradation is to close the
bright meridian of her national splendour?
Quite the reverse: anarchy
has been extinguished in Prussia only
to make room for the fair forms of
order and liberty, which cannot exist
but side by side; the revolutionists
are overawed, but the lovers of real
freedom are only the better confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in their hopes of the ultimate establishment
of a constitutional monarchy,
such as Prussia has been sighing for
for thirty years. It is ever to be
recollected that the prospects of freedom
are never so bright as when they
are in the inverse ratio to those of
revolution; liberty is never so safe as
where anarchy is most thoroughly
repressed; despotism is never so near
at hand as immediately after the
greatest triumphs of insurrection.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Austria</span> a different and more
melancholy prospect has been exhibited.
That great and noble country
has been the victim, not merely of the
passions of revolution, but of those
of race. It has been torn asunder,
not only by the ambition of the
revolutionists, and the ardent zeal
of a people yet inexperienced in
social dissensions sighing after freedom,
but by the force and inextinguishable
rivalry of different and discordant
races. The Lombard has
risen up against the German, the
Bohemian against the Austrian; the
Magyars have buckled on their
armour against both, and, animated
alike by revolutionary zeal and
national jealousy, have striven to
obtain what they deem the first of
blessings&mdash;national independence&mdash;by
revolting against the government of
Austria, in the moment of its utmost
need. That strange compound of
races and nations, the Austrian
monarchy, in which it is hard to say
whether the Slave, the Magyar, the
Teuton, the Lombard, or the old Roman
had the preponderance, and the union
of which, for so long a period, had
been a subject of astonishment to all
observers, at length revealed its inherent
weakness. Worse than the war
of opinion, the war of races began.
Like the Lacedemonian confederacy,
after the defeat of Leuctra, or the
Athenian after the catastrophe of
Aigos Potamos, or the Roman republic
after the disaster of Cannæ, the Austrian
aggregate of kingdoms threatened
to fall to pieces on the dreadful shock
of opinion which resulted from the success
of the French revolution. The
contest of nations did not now intervene,
to bar the spread of democratic
ideas; the military passions were not
arrayed in opposition to the civic.
Lamartine was perfectly right in his
prognostic: the pacific French revolution
of 1848 achieved greater conquests,
in three months, than the warlike
republic of 1793 had gained in
ten years. Prussia was apparently
revolutionised; Austria was all but
won to the democratic side; Vienna,
Prague, and Milan were in the hands
of the insurgents. Never, in the
darkest periods of the revolutionary
war, was Austria in such desperate
straits, as when Radetsky retreated
behind the Mincio, and the treacherous
assault of Charles Albert was
aided by the whole strength of revolutionary
Italy, and the tacit support
or lukewarm indifference of
France and England.</p>

<p>But in that awful hour, by far the
most perilous which Austria ever
knew, and which threatened with immediate
and irrevocable destruction
the whole balance of power in Europe,
she was saved by the fidelity of her
native soldiers, and the incomparable
spirit of her German nobility. Then
appeared in its highest lustre what is
the principle of life and the tenacity
of purpose which exist in an aristocratic
society, not yet wholly debilitated
by the pleasures and the selfishness of
a court. Although the Hungarian
nobles, for the most part, sided with
the Magyar insurgents; although the
whole Lombard troops had passed
over from the standards of Radetsky
to those of Charles Albert, and all the
Hungarians in his service sullenly
wended their way back to their native
places; although Prague was wrested
from the crown by the Bohemian insurgents,
and Vienna by a vehement
urban tumult in the capital; although
Hungary was not only lost, but arrayed
in fierce hostility against the
monarchy&mdash;the noble Austrian leaders
never lost heart&mdash;they realised the
dream of the Roman poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Si fractus illabatur orbis,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Impavidum ferient ruinæ."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Windischgratz in Bohemia, Radetsky
in Italy, Jellachich in Austria,
stood forth as the saviours of the
monarchy, and, with it, of the cause of
European freedom. Though deserted
by their sovereign, who had bent
before the revolutionary tempest, they
fronted, sometimes, it is believed, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
opposition to constrained orders, the
dangers with which they were assailed&mdash;they
acted in conformity with
the maxim of a noble people not yet
debased by democratic selfishness:
<span class="smcap">Vive le Roi quand-meme!</span> Slowly,
but steadily, the forces of order regained
their ascendant over the assaults
of anarchy. The Tyrol, ever
steadfast in its loyalty, first offered an
asylum to the emperor, when driven
from his capital; Prague was next
recovered, and Bohemia coerced by
the moral courage and skilful dispositions
of Prince Windischgratz;
Radetsky, shortly after, reinforced by
the loyalty of Austria, regained his
ascendant on the Mincio, routed the
revolutionary rabble of Italy, and
restored Milan to the Imperial government;
Vienna, after a desperate conflict,
was won by the forces of Order;
and Jellachich and Windischgratz
enjoyed the proud triumph of having
restored his capital to their discrowned
sovereign. Hungary, inhabited by a
bolder and more numerous race, actuated
by stronger passions, held out
longest, and was only subdued after a
sanguinary conflict, by the aroused
vigour and national passions, aided by
the support of the Colossus of the
North, which has so often sent forth
its battalions as the last resource of
order and religion, when all but vanquished
by the forces of anarchy and
infidelity. Yet, though thus constrained,
in the last extremity, to call
in the aid of the Czar, and array a
hundred thousand Muscovites on the
plains of Hungary, the stand thus
made by the Austrian monarchy is
not the less glorious and worthy of
eternal remembrance. It demonstrates
what so many other passages
in the history of that noble people
indicate, how great is the strength,
and unbounded the resources, of a
brave and patriotic nation, even when
afflicted by the most terrible disasters;
and how uniformly Providence, in the
end, lends its protection to a people
who have shown themselves worthy
of its blessings, by faithfully discharging
their duty in a period of
disaster. The year 1849 will ever
rank with the glories of Maria Theresa,
the triumph of Aspern, the devotion
of Wagram, as the brightest periods in
the long and glorious Austrian annals.</p>

<p>The people of England, ever ready
to sympathise with even the name of
freedom, and prone beyond any other
nation to delusions springing from
generous feelings, acting on erroneous
information, were at one time much
disposed to sympathise with the Hungarian
insurgents. They enlisted the
wishes of a considerable part, especially
of the citizens of towns, on their
side. Never were generous and estimable
feelings more misapplied. The
contest in Hungary, it is to be feared,
was not in the slightest degree a
struggle for public freedom: it was an
effort only to establish the <em>domination
of a race</em> in opposition to a lawful
government. Like the Sikhs or Ameers
in India at this moment, the Normans
in England in former times, or the
"insane plebeian noblesse" of Poland,
whom John Sobieski denounced as the
authors of the ruin of his country, the
Magyars were a proud and haughty
dominant race, not a fourth part of the
whole inhabitants of Hungary, but
brave and ambitious, and animated
with the strongest desire of establishing
an independent oligarchy in their wide-spread
country. They took the opportunity
for asserting their principles
when Austria was pierced to the heart,
and its provinces, apparently all falling
asunder, had the fairest prospect of
establishing separate dominions, as in
the ancient Roman empire, on the
ruins of the Imperial authority. Had
they succeeded, they would have established
the same monstrous tyranny of
a dominant race, which has so long
blasted the happiness, and at length
destroyed the independence of Poland.</p>

<p>That the contest in Hungary was
one for the domination of a race, not
the freedom of people, is evident
from two circumstances which have
been studiously kept out of view by
the Liberal party, both on the Continent
and in England. The first is
that <em>after</em> the emperor had conceded to
Hungary the most extreme liberal institutions,
based on universal suffrage,
the Magyar leaders sent private orders
to all the Hungarian regiments in
Radetsky's army to leave his banners,
and return to Hungary; thus rendering
to all appearance the dismemberment
of the monarchy inevitable, and
surrendering the Italian provinces,
the brightest jewel in the Imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
crown, to the tender mercies of
Charles Albert. The second is, that,
in the contest which ensued, the Hungarians
were in the end overthrown.
Possessing, as Hungary does, fourteen
millions of inhabitants&mdash;nearly a
moiety of the whole Austrian empire,
and four times more than Upper and
Lower Austria, with the Tyrol, which
alone could be relied on in that crisis&mdash;it
is evident that, if the <em>whole</em> Hungarian
people had been united, they must
have proved victorious, and have decided
the contest long before the distant
Muscovite battalions could have
appeared on the theatre of war. The
Hungarian insurrection broke out in
April 1848, and was aided by contemporaneous
revolts in Prague, Lombardy,
Venice, and Vienna. To all appearance
the Austrian monarchy was
torn in pieces. Muniments of war
they had in abundance: Comorn,
with its vast arsenal and impregnable
walls, opened its arms to receive them.
When Georgey capitulated, he had one
hundred and thirty-eight guns, besides
those in the hands of Kossuth
and Bem. Fully half the military
stores of Austria fell into the hands of
the Hungarians, the moment the insurrection
broke out. Yet, with all these
advantages, they were overcome. This
demonstrates that the war was not a
national one, in the proper sense of the
word: that is, it did not interest the
<em>whole</em> people. It was an effort of a
gallant and ambitious race, forming a
small minority of the population, to
establish a domination over the whole
remainder of the inhabitants, and
sever themselves from the Austrian
empire; and a greater calamity than
such a separation, both to the Hungarians
themselves and the general
balance of power in Europe, cannot be
imagined.</p>

<p>How was the balance of power to
be maintained in Europe, especially
against Russia, if the Austrian monarchy
had been broken up? Experience
had long ago proved that no coalitions
for the preservation of the independence
of central Europe, either against
Russia on the one side or France on
the other, had the least chance of
success, in which Austria did not take
a prominent part. Even the disasters
of the Peninsular campaigns, and the
awful catastrophe of the Moscow retreat,
could not enable Europe to combat
Napoleon, till Metternich, at the
Congress of Prague, threw the weight
of Austria into the scale. It was
by an alliance of Austria, France, and
England that, at the Congress of
Vienna, a curb was put on the ambition
of Russia: by a similar alliance
that the Turkish empire was saved
from ruin, when the Muscovite standards
were advanced to Adrianople,
and the Pacha of Egypt was encamped
on Scutari. It was a coalition of
Austria, England, Russia, and Prussia,
which in 1834 coerced the ambition
of France, when M. Thiers had sent
orders to the French admiral to attack
and burn the English fleet in the bay
of Vourlas, at dead of night. But if
Austria had been broken up into a
Hungarian, a Lombard, and a Bohemian
republic, how was such an alliance
to be formed? What central power
could, in such an event, have existed
under such circumstances, to oppose a
mid impediment to the grasping ambition
of Russia on the one side, and
France on the other? Prussia, it is well
known, is entirely under the influence
of Russia, and does not, except in the
first fervour of revolution, venture to
deviate from the policy which it prescribes.
Sweden and Denmark are
mere subsidiary states. Austria alone
is so strong as to be able, with the aid
of England, to bid Russia defiance;
and is situated so near to its southern
provinces, as to be actuated by a
ceaseless dread of its encroachments.
The breaking up of the Austrian empire
would have been a fatal blow to
the balance of power, and with it to
real liberty in Europe. It would have
left the field open to the Cossacks on
the one side, and the Red Republicans
on the other.</p>

<p>It is deeply to be regretted that
Austria was not able to regain its
dominion over its rebellious Hungarian
subjects, without the aid of the
Muscovite arms. Although the Czar
has recalled his troops after the vast
service was rendered, and no projects
of immediate aggrandisement are
apparent, yet it is impossible to doubt&mdash;it
is fruitless to attempt to disguise&mdash;that
the influence of Russia in the
east of Europe has been immensely
extended by this intervention. So
weighty an obligation as saving an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
empire from dismemberment is too
great to be easily forgotten; and
supposing, what is probably the case,
that gratitude is a feeling unknown to
cabinets&mdash;and that the recollection of
salvation from ruin is likely to produce
no other sentiment but that of
dislike&mdash;still the contest, which was
adjourned, rather than decided, on the
Hungarian plains, has for a very long
period, it is to be feared, thrown
Austria into the arms of Russia.
They are united by the common bond
of enduring interest. The Magyars
in Hungary, the Poles in Sarmatia,
are the enemies of both; and each
feels that it is by a close alliance of
the cabinets, that the evident dangers
of an insurrection of these powerful
and warlike races can be provided
against. It is more than probable
that a secret treaty, offensive and
defensive, already unites the two
powers; that the crushing of the
Magyars was bought by the condition,
that the extension of Muscovite
influence in Turkey was to be connived
at; and that the Czar will one
day advance to Constantinople without
fear, because he knows that his
right flank is secure on the side of
Austria. Certain it is, that the <em>joint</em>
demand made by Austria and Russia,
for the extradition of the Hungarian
refugees, and which, as all unwarrantable
stretch against the independence
of Turkey, was resisted with so much
spirit and wisdom by England and
France, looks very like the first-fruits
of such an alliance. And observe,
now, the immediate effects on the
balance of power of the revolution of
1848. This invasion of the independence
of Turkey was made by Russia
and Austria in concert, and was only
resisted by France and England!
Woful, indeed, for the interests of
real freedom, has been the result of
those convulsions which have ended
in transplanting Austria from its natural
position, and have converted the
jealous opponent of Muscovite power
into its obsequious ally. Nothing
could have effected such a metamorphosis,
but the terrible convulsion
which almost tore out the entrails of
the Austrian empire. But that is
ever the case with revolutionists.
Blinded by the passions with which
they are actuated, they rush headlong
on their own destruction; and destroy,
in their insane ambition, the
very bulwarks by which alone durable
freedom is to be secured in their own
or any other country.</p>

<p>It is commonly thought in this
country that the war in Hungary was
a contest for national independence,
and that it bears a close analogy to the
memorable conflicts by which, in former
times, the independence of Scotland
was maintained, or the liberties
of England purchased. There never
was a more unfounded opinion. <em>After</em>
the Hungarian insurrection had taken
place, indeed, and when the Austrian
empire had been wellnigh torn to
pieces in the shock, Hungary was
formally incorporated with Austria,
just as the grand-duchy of Warsaw
was with Russia after the sanguinary
revolt of 1831, and Ireland with England
after the rebellion of 1798. But
<em>anterior</em> to the revolution, what step
had the cabinet of Vienna taken
which was hostile to the independence
of Hungary? Not one. The constitution
which the Austrian government
had given to the Hungarians, if it
erred at all, did so on the liberal side:
for it conceded to a people, scarcely
emerged from barbarism, a constitution
founded on universal suffrage,
such as England, with its centuries of
freedom, could not withstand for three
months. It was the Hungarian insurgents
who are responsible for the
loss of their national independence;
because they first put it in issue by
joining Lombardy and the revolutionists
of Prague and Vienna, in their
assault upon the Imperial government,
at a time when nothing whatever
had been done which menaced their
separate existence. The truth is,
they thought, as many others did, that
the Austrian empire was breaking up,
and that now was the time to become
a separate power. Having voluntarily,
and without a cause, committed
high treason, they cannot complain
with reason, if in a mitigated form
they incur its penalties by forfeiting
their national existence.</p>

<p>The ultimate suppression of the
revolt in Hungary has been attended
with a most distressing amount of
bloodshed on the scaffold, and the
occurrence of several mournful scenes,
in which courage and fidelity have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
asserted their wonted superiority, in
the supreme hour, over all the storms
of fate. God forbid that we should
either justify or approve of such severity,
or deprive the heroic Hungarian
leaders of the well-earned praise which
some of them deserve, for their noble
constancy in misfortune! But while
fully admitting this on the one hand,
we must, in justice to the Austrian
government on the other, recall to recollection
the circumstances in which
they were placed at the close of the
contest, the dangers they had undergone,
and the dreadful devastation
which the Hungarian war had brought
upon their country. When Georgey
capitulated and Comorn surrendered,
Austria was wellnigh exhausted by
the conflict: she had owed her salvation
in part at least to foreign intervention.
She had been forced to proclaim
her weakness in the face of
Europe, and to bring down the hated
Muscovite battalions into the heart of
the empire. In judging of the course
which her rulers, when victorious, pursued,
we must in justice recall to mind
the perils they had escaped, and the
humiliations to which they had been
reduced. We must recollect also the
state of civilisation which Hungary
has attained, and go back, in imagination,
to what we ourselves did in a
similar stage of national progress.
Hungary is hardly more advanced in
civilisation than England was during
the Wars of the Roses, when the prisoners
on both sides were put to death
without mercy, and eighty princes of
the blood or nobles were massacred
in cold blood; or than Scotland was
when the Covenanters murdered all
the Irish in Montrose's army, with
their wives and children. What did
the English government do at Carlisle
after the advance of the Pretender to
Derby, or in Ireland after the rebellion
of 1798? What has she recently
done in the Ionian islands, after the
insurrection in Cephalonia? Nay,
would we have been less rigorous than
the Austrians, even at this time, if we
had been reduced to similar extremities?
It is very easy to be lenient
after an insurrection which has been
extinguished in a cabbage garden, and
rendered the insurgents ridiculous in
the eyes of all the world; but what
should we have done, and how would
we have felt, if Smith O'Brien at the
head of the Irish rebels had invaded
England, taken London, nourished
for a year and a half a frightful civil
war in the heart of the empire, and
compelled us to call in the legions of
France into the midland counties to
save the nation from ruin? We do
not mean, by these observations, to
justify the executions of Haynau and
the other Imperial generals: God
knows, we deplore them as much as
any one can do, and yield to none in
admiration of the heroism of the Hungarian
leaders, who have shown themselves
so worthy of the noble nation
to which they belong. But we extenuate,
if we cannot justify, the severity
of the Austrians, by the recollection
of their sufferings; and reserve
the weight of our indignation for those
insane and selfish demagogues who, for
their own elevation, lighted so terrible
a conflagration, and caused so much
noble blood to be shed, alike on the
part of those who fanned and those
who sought to extinguish the flames.</p>

<p>The third circumstance which seems
to have mainly tended to stop the
progress of revolution in Europe, has
been the great amount of <em>interests</em> in
France which could not fail to be injured,
either by foreign warfare or
domestic Socialist triumph. This is
mainly owing to France having already
undergone fusion in the revolutionary
crucible. Scarcely anything remains
to melt, but the dross which had
flowed out of the first furnace. The
great estates and church lands were
divided; two-thirds were cut off from
the national debt. Nobody remained
to despoil but the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tiers état</i> and revolutionary
proprietors. They stood
shoulder to shoulder in defence of their
all, which they saw was seriously
menaced; and thence the stoppage of
the revolution at Paris, and the rapid
retrograde movement of opinion on the
subject, in the majority, over all France.
Foreign war was not less an object of
apprehension than internal spoliation.
The peasants recollected the conscription
and the Cossacks, and the weighty
contributions of the Allies; the bourgeois
dreaded the cessation of foreign
travelling in their country, and the
termination of the prolific shower of
English gold. It was a general terror
that the best interests of society were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
in danger which produced the determined
resistance to the insurgents in
Paris on the 23d of June, and formed
the majority of four millions who
elected Prince Louis Napoleon to the
president's chair. Beyond all doubt,
the greater part of the electors, when
they recorded their suffrages for him,
understood they were really voting for
an emperor, and opposing the barrier
of force to the revolution.</p>

<p>This circumstance suggests a very
important consideration, on which it
well becomes the people of this country
to ponder, in reasoning from the
example of France to themselves. It
is not unusual now to hear the opinion
advanced, that the result of universal
suffrage in France proves that the
apprehensions entertained on this subject,
on this side of the Channel, are
unfounded; and that, in truth, there is
no such effectual barrier against revolution
as universal, or, at least, a very
low suffrage. America is frequently
referred to, also, in confirmation of the
same opinion. But under what circumstances
has universal suffrage been
forced to uphold property in these two
countries? Recollect that both are overspread
with a host of small proprietors:
in France no less than 6,000,000
persons, for the most part in very indigent
circumstances, being holders of
land; and in America, the whole soil,
from its having been so recently reclaimed
from the forest, and the law
of equal succession, <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">ab intestato</i>, being
in the hands of the actual cultivators.
But can any opinion be formed from
this as to what would be the effect of a
change in the electoral law, which
created 6,000,000 of voters in a country
where there are not 300,000
holders of land, and not above an
equal number of proprietors in the
funds? It is evident that we can
never argue from a country which <em>has
been revolutionised</em>, and where property
<em>has been divided</em>, to one where
neither of these events has taken place.
Doubtless the robber will make a fight
before he allows his prey to be torn
from him; and when there are six
millions of persons, for the most part
possessed of the fruits of robbery, the
rendering these back will not be very
easily effected. But if we would see
the effect of an extended suffrage, in a
country which has not been revolutionised,
and where the strong curb-chain
of individual interest does not exist
to restrain the majority, we
have only to look to what the electors
of France in 1793 did with the estates
of the church and the nobility; to
what the American freeholders did in
1837, when they destroyed five-sixths
commercial wealth of the country, by
raising the cry "Bank, or no Bank:"
or what the British ten-pounders have
done with the other classes of society,
and, eventually, though they did not
intend it, with themselves, by their
measures of free trade and a restricted
currency. Beyond all doubt, <em>these</em>
measures would at once be repealed
by an extended constituency; but
are we sure they would stop there?
What security have we they would
not apply the sponge to the National
Debt, confiscate the church property,
and openly, or by a graduated assessment
on land, divide the estates of the
nobility?</p>

<p>But perhaps the most powerful
agent, which has been at work, in
stopping the progress of revolution
in Europe, has been the public and
private <span class="smcap">Insolvency</span> which in an abandoned
state of society inevitably and
rapidly follows such convulsions. This
is the great check upon the government
and the madness of the people.
That France, ever since the revolution
of February 1848, has been in a state
of almost hopeless monetary embarrassment,
is well known to all the
world. In fact, nothing but the most
consummate prudence, and the adoption
of the wisest measures on the part
of the Bank of France, has saved them
from a general public and private bankruptcy.
What those measures were,
will immediately be explained. In
the mean time, to show the magnitude
of the difficulties against which they
had to make head, it is sufficient to
observe, that in twenty-one months
the Revolutionary Government has incurred
a floating debt of £22,000,000;
and that the deficiency for the year
1849, wholly unprovided for&mdash;and
which must be made good by Exchequer
bills, or other temporary expedients&mdash;is
no less than <em>eleven millions
and a half sterling</em>. It is not surprising
it should have swelled to this
enormous amount; for the very first
demand of revolutionists, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have proved victorious, is to diminish
the public burdens and increase the
public expenditure. And they did
this so effectually in France, that in
one year after the revolution of 1848,
they had increased the public expenditure
by 162,000,000 francs, or
about £6,500,000; while they had
caused the public revenue to fall
by 248,000,000 francs, or nearly
£10,000,000!</p>

<p>The dreadful prostration of industry
which such a state of the public
revenue implies, would have proved
altogether fatal to France, had it not
been rescued from the abyss by the
surpassing wisdom with which, in
that crisis, the measures of the Bank
of France were conducted. But the
conduct of that establishment, at
that trying crisis, proved that they
had taken a lesson from the archives
of history. Carefully shunning the
profuse and exorbitant issue of paper
which, under the name of assignats,
effected so dreadful a destruction of
property in France in the first revolution,
they imitated the cautious and
prudent policy by which Mr Pitt surmounted
the crisis of 1797, and
brought the nation triumphant through
the whole dangers of the war. They
obtained an act from the legislature
authorising the issue, not of
£600,000,000 sterling of notes, as in
1793 and 1794, but of 400,000,000
francs, or £16,000,000 sterling, not
convertible into gold and silver. This,
and this alone, it was that brought
France through the crisis of the Revolution.
Specie, before this aid was
obtained, was fast disappearing from
circulation; the Bank of France had
suspended cash payments; three of
the principal banks in Paris had become
bankrupt; the payment of all
bills was suspended by act of government&mdash;for
this plain reason, that no
debtor could find cash to discharge his
engagements. But this wise measure
gave the French people that most inestimable
of all blessings in a political
and monetary crisis&mdash;a currency
which, without being redundant, is
sufficient, and, being not convertible
into the precious metals, neither augments
the strain on them, nor is liable
to be swept away by foreign export.
In consequence of this seasonable
advance, the crisis was surmounted,
though not without most acute general
suffering; and industry, since a government
comparatively stable was
established, in the person of Prince
Louis Napoleon, has revived to a
surprising degree over the whole
country. Indeed, it may be doubted
whether the general misery which
prevailed in France, desolated by a
revolution, but sustained by a moderate
inconvertible paper currency, was
greater than was felt in the manufacturing
cities of Great Britain, saved
by the firmness of government and
the good sense of the nation from a
political convulsion, but withering
under the fetters of a contracted currency,
and unrestricted admission of
foreign produce.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>One thing is perfectly apparent
from the result of the revolution in
Italy, that the establishment of either
civil liberty or political independence
is hopeless in that beautiful peninsula.
The total and easy rout of the
Piedmontese and Tuscan forces by
Radetsky is a proof of this. Venice
was defended by its Lagunæ&mdash;Rome
not by the descendants of the ancient
masters of the world, but by the revolutionary
mercenaries of Poland,
Hungary, and Germany, whom the
Austrian victories drove back from
the banks of the Po to those of the
Tiber. On the other hand, the
example of Naples, where the firmness
of the king has preserved in the end
his dominions entire, though Sicily for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
a time was severed from the kingdom,
and Naples itself was the theatre of a
bloody convulsion, proves alike of
what flimsy materials revolution is
composed in the south of Europe, and
through what a perilous crisis a nation
can be safely conducted, when
the depositaries of power are not unworthy
of the elevated duties with
which they are entrusted.</p>

<p>Still more important is the lesson
read to the world by the attempted
revolution in England and Ireland.
That Great Britain was threatened
with the convulsions, in the throes of
which France and Germany were labouring,
is universally known. The
Chartists openly declared that monarchy
could not stand two months in
England or Scotland; the Repealers
were counting the hours till the Saxon
was expelled from the Emerald Isle,
and a Hibernian republic proclaimed
in Dublin, in close alliance with the
great parent democracy in Paris.
Where are these boasters now? The
English revolutionists were morally
slaughtered in London on the 10th
April: the Irish rebels were blown
into the air by the fire of the police in
the cabbage garden. They have been
more than vanquished; they have
been rendered ridiculous. In despair,
they are now leaving in crowds their
wo-stricken isle; and it is to be hoped
a better race, more industrious habits,
and a more tractable people, will gradually
be introduced into the deserts
which Celtic improvidence and folly
has made. It is a glorious spectacle
to see an attempted revolution which
broke out in both islands suppressed
almost without the effusion of blood;
and England, the first-born of freedom
in modern times, reasserting, in
its advanced period of existence, at
once the order and moderation which
are the glorious inheritance of genuine
Liberty.</p>

<p>Would that we could say that our
foreign policy during the two last
eventful years has been as worthy of
praise, as the conduct of our government
in combating our internal enemies
has been. But here the meed
of our approbation must fail. Contrary
alike to our obvious interests
and to our real and long-established
principles, we have apparently been
guided by no other principle but that
of fomenting revolution, after the example
of France, in every country
which the contagion had reached.
We all but severed Sicily from Naples,
and openly assisted the Sicilian insurgents
with arms and ammunition.
We once stopped, for "humanity's
sake," the Neapolitan expedition
from sailing to combat the rebels: we
more than once interposed in favour
of Charles Albert and the Piedmontese
revolutionists: we have alienated
Austria, it is to be feared, beyond
redemption, by our strange and tortuous
policy in regard to the Hungarian
insurrection: we, without disguise,
countenanced the revolutionary
Germans in their attack upon the
Danes. What object Ministers had
in that, or how they thought the interests
of England, a great commercial
and exporting nation, were to be
forwarded by throwing its whole customers
into confusion and misery, we
cannot divine. Apparently, their
sympathy with revolution anywhere
but at home, was so strong, that they
could not abstain from supporting it
all around them, though to the infinite
detriment of their own people.
And it is a most curious circumstance,
that, while the Chancellor of the Exchequer
constantly told us&mdash;no doubt
with a certain degree of truth&mdash;that
the failure of our exports, and the
general distress of the country, was, in
a great degree, to be ascribed to the
European revolutions, the whole policy
of the Foreign Office, during the same
period, was directed to countenance
and support these very revolutions.</p>

<p>But from the painful contemplation
of the follies and aberrations of man, let
us turn, with thankfulness, to the contemplation
of the great moral lessons
which the events of the two last years
teach us as to the wisdom and beneficence
of Nature. It is now clear beyond
the possibility of doubt, that the
wisdom of Providence has provided
barriers against the passions, vices, and
follies of men; and that if the leaders
in thought and station fail in their
duty, an invisible bulwark against the
progress of anarchy is provided in the
general misery which is the consequence
of their excesses. Pre-eminent
above all others in the history of
mankind, <small>THE YEAR OF REACTION</small>,
immediately succeeding <small>THE YEAR OF REVOLUTIONS</small><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>, is fraught with the demonstration
of these great and consoling
moral and religious truths.
From it the patriot will derive consolation
and hope, amidst the darkest
periods which may yet be in store for
the human race: for never was a darker
period than that through which we
have passed; and from its checkered
scenes the virtuous and upright will
draw the conclusion that there are
limits to human wickedness even in
this scene of trial; and that the safest,
not less than the most honourable
course, for all classes, from the throne
to the cottage, in periods of danger,
is to be found in the fearless discharge
of <small>DUTY</small>.</p>

<h2>MY PENINSULAR MEDAL.</h2>

<h3>BY AN OLD PENINSULAR.</h3>

<h4>PART III.&mdash;CHAPTER VII.</h4>


<p>Next morning, shortly after daybreak,
we were all hurried out of our
berths by Joey, to come on deck,
and take a first view of the coast of
Spain. We made the land to the
north-east of Cape Villano, and were
not a little struck with the bare, black,
scowling aspect of that mountainous
and iron-bound coast. Off Oporto we
stood in, with the design of entering the
river. But a signal from the shore announced
the bar impassable, and we had
nothing before us but the delightful
prospect of standing off and on, till
the weather permitted us to land the
bags. Gingham, I observed, stood
anxiously peering with his telescope
in the direction of the bar, where the
sea, for miles, was foam and fury.
"Well," said I at last, "are you
looking for a cork in that yeast?"&mdash;"I
am," replied Gingham, "and there
it is. See, they have passed the bar.
We shall soon have them alongside."</p>

<p>I saw nothing, but at length was
able to discern in the distance a small
speck, which was executing most extraordinary
vagaries in the midst of
the surf. Now it was high, now low;
now visible, now lost. Its approach
was indicated, not so much by any
perceptible change of position, as by
an increase of apparent magnitude.
Gingham now handed me the glass,
and I saw a large boat, full of men,
pulling towards us like Tritons. At
length they reached the ship. Smart
fellows those Oporto boatmen&mdash;know
how to handle those clumsy-looking,
enormous boats of theirs. What a
scene was that alongside! The wind
high; the sea rough; the boat banging
against the ship's side; the men in
her all talking together. Talking?
Say jabbering, shouting, screaming. I
was in perfect despair. Where was my
Portuguese? Hadn't I studied it at
Trinity College, Cambridge? Couldn't
I make out a page of my Portuguese
Gil Blas? Hadn't I got a Portuguese
grammar and dictionary in my trunk?
And hadn't I got a nice little volume
of Portuguese dialogues in my pocket?
Yet not one word could I understand
of what those fellows in the boat were
bawling about. Their idiom was provincial,
their pronunciation Spanish.
That I didn't know. It seemed to me,
at the time, that all my toil had
been wasted. Never despair, man.
If you want to learn a language, and
can't learn it in the country, why,
learn it at home. You may, you probably
will, feel at a loss, when you
first get among the natives. But,
after two or three days, all will begin
to come right: your ear, untutored
hitherto, will begin to do its part;
then your stores of previously acquired
knowledge will all come into use, and
you may jabber away to your heart's
content. But mind, whatever the
language you learn&mdash;Portuguese,
Spanish, French, Italian, or High
Dutch&mdash;go to work in a scholarlike,
businesslike manner; learn the verbs,
study the syntax, master all the technicalities,
or you are doing no good.
Doubtless, in your travels abroad,
you will fall in with lively old English
residents, who "speak the language
as fluently as a native," and tell you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
it's all nonsense, <em>they</em> never looked
into a grammar, nor into a book
neither. But never mind that; follow
your own plan. Speak the language
whenever you can&mdash;that of
course; hear it spoken; dine at the
table d'hôte&mdash;that's worth a five shilling
lesson at any time, and you get
your dinner extra; but, all the while,
read daily, work your grammar, turn
out the words in your dictionary, and
mark the result. You, after a space,
can not only speak the language, but
<em>write</em> it; whereas those intelligent
individuals, let alone writing, can't
<em>read</em> it. Another suggestion, which
I&mdash;but where are we? What are we
talking about? While I am boring
you with suggestions, the despatches
have been handed into the boat; the
boat has shoved off, and is making for
the shore&mdash;plunging, ramping, tearing
through the surf under a press of sail:
and, on the deck of the Princess Wilhelmina
gun-brig, stand three new and
very rum-looking passengers&mdash;a Spaniard,
a Portuguese, and a nondescript&mdash;one
deal box, one old leathern portmanteau,
one canvass bag, two umbrellas
(blue,) one ditto (red,) and a
high-crowned Spanish hat, tied up in
a faded cotton pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p>Our new companions were all a
little "indisposed" the first day; but,
the weather moderating in the night,
they grew better the next, and were
able to take their places at the dinner
table. The Spaniard had come on
board, assuming that he was to victual
himself, or pay extra. Under this
impression, opening his box in the
forenoon, he produced with much
gravity a bundle, consisting of half-a-dozen
oranges, some very coarse
brown bread, a flask of wine, and a
chump of splendid garlick sausage,
all tied up together, in a second cotton
pocket-handkerchief. Spreading
said handkerchief on the cabin table
as a cloth, he next brought out from
his pocket a formidable cheese-toaster,
and was preparing to do battle with
the prog. The Major, perceiving his
mistake, addressed him in Spanish,
politely explaining that the passage-money
covered everything, and that
he could call for whatever the ship
afforded. The Hidalgo, thus advised,
and courteously thanking the
Major, contented himself with an
orange, carefully tied up the remaining
provender as before, and restored
it to the sky-blue deal box.</p>

<p>This act of the Major's, benignant
reader, piqued my curiosity. The
Major was a very good fellow, as you
have doubtless discovered ere this;
but he was not a man to do anything
without a <em>motive</em>. I couldn't feel
easy, without getting to the bottom of
it.</p>

<p>"Very kind of you, Major," said I,
"to give the Don that information
respecting his rights <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in transitu</i>."</p>

<p>"Kind?" said the Major indignantly;
"what do you mean by
kind? Had he once attacked that
sausage, we should have smelt garlic
all the way to Lisbon." I now
appreciated the Major's urbanity.</p>

<p>"Close fellows, those Spaniards,"
added the Major. "I knew very
well he wouldn't give me part of his
sausage. Didn't go for it."</p>

<p>"Why, if you had shared the feast,"
said I, "we should have smelt garlic
twice as bad."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the Major "but
<em>I</em> shouldn't have smelt it <em>at all</em>."</p>

<p>Said hidalgo was a tall, kiln-dried
attomy of a man&mdash;hair black and
lanky&mdash;forehead high and corrugated&mdash;eyebrows
pencilled and elevated&mdash;eyes
almost closed by the dropping of
the eyelids&mdash;nose long, thin, and very
inexpressive&mdash;mouth diminutive&mdash;chin
sharp&mdash;cheek-bones high and
enormously prominent&mdash;cheeks hollow
and cadaverous, regular excavations;
half one of his oranges, stuck
in each, would about have brought
them to a level with his face. Of
course he was dubbed Don Quixotte.
The Portuguese came on board
with his hair dressed as a wig, enormous
white choker, no neck (that's why I
called him Punch,) <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chapeau de bras</i>,
short black cock-tail coat, white silk
waistcoat flowered green and gold,
black satin unmentionables, black
silk stockings, and top-boots&mdash;the
tops a sort of red japan. As to the
third visitor, no one could assert
who he was, or what he was. He
obtained a passage without any document
from the Oporto authorities, on
the plea that he was a courier, and
carried despatches from Oporto to
Lisbon. This, the Colonel remarked,
was rather odd, as the bag generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
went by land. One said he was a
Spaniard; another said he was a
Jew. Gingham pronounced him a
Frenchman:&mdash;but what could a
Frenchman be doing there? The
one index of his identity was a nose,
which forthwith won him the name of
'Hookey.' Hookey spoke French,
Spanish, Portuguese, lots besides&mdash;disclaimed
English&mdash;yet seemed always
listening while we talked. He
was constantly smiling, too; the
habit had given him a deep semicircular
maxillary furrow&mdash;say trench
if you will&mdash;on each side of his ugly
mug. There was something in his
smile that I didn't like. If he saw
you looking at him, he put on a
smile.</p>

<p>At dinner the Colonel, anxious to
do the honours, took an early opportunity
of challenging Don Quixotte to
a glass of wine. The Don filled a
bumper; the Colonel nodded: the
Don, with majestic and silent gravity,
rose slowly from his seat, his glass in
one hand, the other on his heart;
bowed profoundly to each of the company
in succession; tossed off the
wine; melo-dramatically extended
the empty glass at arm's length;
bowed again; sighed; squeezed his
hand very hard upon his heart, and
sat down. The Major challenged
Punch, who half filled his tumbler,
sipped, filled up with water, sipped
again, nodded then, not before, as if
he would say "Now it will do," and
drank off the whole. Captain Gabion
challenged Hookey, who, alone of the
three, performed correctly. "Hookey,
my boy," thought I, "where did you
learn that?"</p>

<p>Neither Punch nor Don Quixotte
manifested the least disposition to
amalgamate with us. They kept
themselves apart, replied civilly when
addressed&mdash;that was all. I must say,
speaking from my own observations,
it is a slander which describes the
English abroad as exclusive. The
exclusiveness, so far as I have seen,
lies much more with the Continentals.</p>

<p>But if, on the present occasion, the
Spaniard and the Portuguese kept
their distance, it certainly was far
otherwise with my friend Hookey. I
take the liberty of calling him my
friend, because I was particularly
honoured by his attentions. I have
already said that he seemed interested
in our conversation. The interest
extended to everything about us. He
inquired respecting each and every
one; his name, his rank, his department,
his destination: asked me, in
an off-hand way, if I could guess how
many troops the British general had&mdash;what
was to be the plan of the ensuing
campaign&mdash;did our Government
intend to carry on the war with vigour?
When, by inquiring elsewhere,
he discovered that I was attached to
the military chest, he redoubled his
attentions, and eke his interrogatories.
Had I bullion on board? How much?
Should I convey treasure from Lisbon
to headquarters? On bullock-cars
or on mules? By what route? Of
course I should have a guard&mdash;did I
know? Travelling up the country
would be dangerous as the army advanced
into Spain&mdash;wouldn't it advance?&mdash;when?&mdash;he
knew every part
of the Peninsula&mdash;was himself bound
for headquarters after delivering his
despatches&mdash;would be happy to go
with me&mdash;wouldn't mind waiting a
day or two in Lisbon&mdash;would assist
me in obtaining a servant&mdash;a horse&mdash;a
mule&mdash;anything. I, communicative
as he was inquisitive, lavished information
in floods; advised him as to
the amount of bullion on board, to go
down into the hold, and see with his
own eyes; informed him, as a particular
secret, that I shouldn't wonder
if I was sent to headquarters, unless
it happened otherwise; and hadn't
the least doubt that I should have the
conveyance of whatever amount of
treasure was placed under my charge
for that purpose; declined saying anything
then about a servant, horse, or
mule, as I should probably find "Milord
Vilinton" had thought of me, and
had everything of that kind ready
against my arrival; begged to tell
him I was a person of great importance,
but maintaining the strictest
incognito&mdash;hoped he wouldn't mention
it. Presently he stole away to the
forecastle, where I got a sight of him.
He was jotting down like mad.</p>

<p>On the evening of our second day
from Oporto, we made the Berlings;
been six weeks at sea, from leaving
the Tagus. If, instead of coasting it,
which secured them a foul wind, they
had struck out at once, from the mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
of the river, two or three days' sail
into the Atlantic, they would probably
have got the wind they wanted. That
is what Captain Nil did, when I came
home, passenger from Lisbon, 1843,
in his clever little fruit-ship, the King
Alfred. Didn't we give the go-by to
the northerly current which blows
down the coast, and catch a south-wester,
which was just what we
needed? Didn't we jockey two other
orangemen, that started in company,
and thought to beat us by working up
along shore? And didn't we bring
our prime oranges first to market, and
sell them off-hand at London Bridge,
with an extra profit of ten shillings a
chest?</p>

<p>The morning after we passed the
Berlings, we saw the Rock of Lisbon.
This, I suppose, is about the most
striking object the mariner beholds,
in approaching any coast in the known
world. Not more than fifteen hundred
feet above the level of the sea, it stands
so dark in tint, so grim in aspect, so
ragged in outline, you fancy some
fresh earthquake has heaved it up,
crude and pinnacled, from the volcanic
bowels of the soil, and there left it to
frown above the waves that thunder
at its base, and spout up in unavailing
froth and fume. "There it stands,"
said Gingham, "the old Rock! Often
have I rounded it before; often have I
viewed it; often have I ranged it:
worthy the attention of the naturalist;
still more of the geologist; but, above
all, of the meteorologist: the Promontory
of the Moon; yes,</p>

<p class="noind">the advanced guard of mountain
ridges, that condense the invisible
vapours of the ocean; the medium
and thoroughfare of electric communication
between Europe and the
Atlantic! See how the thin air of the
tropics becomes mist, when it reaches
those thunder-splintered pinnacles&mdash;hem!
<em>Lady of the Lake</em>. See how it
caps them with a perpetual cloud,
which, though perpetual, is constantly
diminished by the moisture which it
discharges, and constantly replenished
by fresh supplies of vapour from the
sea. Here, the wind is north: but
there, in that elevated region, the
upper current is blowing steadily from
the south-west. Take my advice,
Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;. Don't leave Lisbon without
visiting the Rock. Go to Cintra.
Inquire for Madam Dacey's hotel;
and don't allow her to charge you
more than two dollars a-day, wine
included, spirits and bottled porter
extra."</p>

<p>Gingham now drew out his telescope.
"Ah!" said he, "there's
Colares; and there's Cintra, just at
the base of the Penha. There goes
a donkey party, on a visit to the Cork
Convent. My respects to the old
Capuchins. There's Madam Dacey
herself, fat and rosy as ever, scolding
Francisco the cook for spoiling that
omelet. How are you, old lady?&mdash;Villain!
He's making a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pâté</i> with one
hand, and taking snuff with the other!
Don't roast that hare, blockhead; it's
dry enough already. Make it into
soup. That's the way to serve a
Cintra hare. Clap a thin slice of
bacon on the breast of each of those
red partridges, before you put them
down. What, boil that gurnet?
Bake it, bake it, stupid! Serve it up
cold for supper: beats lobster, and
should be dressed the same way&mdash;oil,
cayenne, vinegar, and a modicum of
salt. I say, Francisco; mind you
send up the soup hot. What an extraordinary
fact, Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;! You
may get good soups, and all the
materials for good dinners, go where
you will; but our own countrymen
are the only people in the world who
know how a dinner should be served
up, and set on table. Why, sir, at
those hotels at Lisbon and Cintra,
I've tasted most splendid soups,
magnificent!&mdash;but, positively, sent to
table lukewarm&mdash;neither hot nor cold&mdash;tepid,
sir! what do you think of
that?"</p>

<p>I was thinking, just at that moment,
that I should like to hear more
about Cintra. But Gingham had now
got on the subject of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la cuisine</i>; <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la
cuisine</i> was one of his hobbies (he
kept a <em>stud</em>)&mdash;and, once mounted,
there was no getting him off. Yet
Gingham, much as he delighted in
dinner-giving, was not himself a gourmand.
In him the passion was disinterested&mdash;a
matter of taste&mdash;a
sentiment. And ah! need I add<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
how it enhanced the value of his
friendship?</p>

<p>About noon we crossed the bar; by
two <small>P.M.</small> were off Lisbon, and, while
I was all agape, admiring the surpassing
beauties of the scene, had dropped
our anchor. Captain Gabion
took me by the elbow, and proposed
that we should sojourn at the same
hotel. The motive transpired that
afternoon. Gingham had his own
quarters, in the Rua d'Alecrim. We
all landed together at the Yellow
House, where our luggage underwent
an examination&mdash;in those days a very
off-hand business, the English, in fact,
being in military occupation of the
country. My traps were despatched
among the first; and I sat waiting for
the Captain, whose turn came later.
Meanwhile Hookey's bag was opened,
and the contents turned out. Among
them I expected to see a letterbox;
but there was nothing that looked
like despatches. While Hookey was
engaged with his bag, he was joined
by a shabby-genteel personage, who
had the look of a military man in
plain clothes&mdash;an Englishman, or, I
rather thought, an Irishman. They recognised
each other at once, and seemed
to meet by appointment&mdash;left the
office arm in arm, the new-comer carrying
Hookey's bag. They passed without
observing me, as I sat in the background
near the door, among bags
and boxes. <em>Both</em> were speaking
<em>English</em>: <em>i. e.</em>, Hookey, English as it
is spoken by Frenchmen; his companion,
English as it ought to be
spoken, the pure vernacular of the
Sister Isle. "Kim, kim away wid
ye, now; isn't it aal krikt and wrigler?"&mdash;"Oh,
yase; now I sal comb
vid you, presently." "Aha! Mister
Hookey; so you don't understand
English," thought I. Not to be an
eavesdropper, I started up, and put
out my paw, in tender of a parting
shake. Hookey, a little taken aback,
clasped it fervently in both his; and,
repudiating disguise, laughed, and
spoke English again, grasping and
shaking my fist with intense cordiality.
I suppose it was his surprise,
that made him substitute greeting for
leave-taking: "Ah, how you do,
sare? I hope you varraval."</p>

<p>Gingham took a kind but rather
distant leave. The Captain and I
adjourned with our luggage, which
was first cleverly laid together and
packed, and then borne, swinging by
ropes from two bars, which rested on
the shoulders of four stout Gallegos,
who walked two and two, hugging
each other round the neck, and stepping
together in admirable time. The
Captain indicated the road; and we
soon reached our domicile, MacDermot's
Hotel (as it was then called),
Rua do Prior, Buenos Ayres,&mdash;for
air and prospect, the finest situation
in all Lisbon; and that is not saying
a little.</p>

<p>I was for ordering dinner forthwith.
The Captain, for reasons best known
to himself, wished an hour's delay.
Reluctantly acceding, I retired to my
private apartment, and commenced
operations in the soap and dowlas
line. Presently the Captain tapped
at my door, and entered. Wanted
me just to walk down with him to the
water's side&mdash;wanted me particularly.
Away we went. The Captain spoke
little&mdash;seemed to have some project.
At length he opened: "I rather think
the skipper will catch a precious good
hiding presently; serve him right."
All this was Greek to me, though I
had heard something of the skipper's
bad conduct to the Major.</p>

<p>We now, having descended by a
side street as steep as a ladder,
entered the main road, or broadway,
which runs by the water's side. Who
should meet us there, but the Major?
He was evidently on the look-out for
us, and joined forthwith. "Has the
boat left the brig yet?" said Captain
Gabion.</p>

<p>"Not yet, I think," said the
Major; "I saw her alongside, though.
Come down to the water's edge.
That's the place."</p>

<p>We descended, through a passage
between stone walls. Captain
Gabion now addressed me a second
time: "Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;, I have already undertaken
to officiate as the Major's
friend. You must pick up the skipper."</p>

<p>"Well, but what's it all about?"
said I. "Hadn't any idea of your
intention. You never told me."</p>

<p>"No time for explanation now,"
said the Captain. "Will you officiate,
or will you not?"</p>

<p>"Always ready to do the needful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
when the case requires," said I.
"But, if the Major feels himself
aggrieved, is there no other redress?
Won't it be <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">infra dig.</i>?"</p>

<p>"The fact is," said the Major,
"I don't intend to give him a <em>heavy</em>
licking&mdash;only just to polish him off a
bit. As to redress, if I lodged a complaint,
it must come ultimately before
our own authorities. Now Englishmen
abroad, when ill-treated, are
always ignored or deserted by their
government. I've seen that often.
That rascal would get off scot-free;
and the very fact of my having applied
would be remembered to my
disadvantage, and perhaps would injure
me in my profession. If I was a
Frenchman or a Yankee travelling
abroad, and had been oppressed or
ill-treated, I would apply to my government.
But as I am an Englishman,
what would be the use?"</p>

<p>"Well," said I, "the skipper's conduct
on board was very bad, I admit;
to you, I've heard, particularly. But
it's all over now. Come, let him off
this time."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Major. "In
a fortnight he sails for England&mdash;takes
home a ship-load of British officers,
sick, wounded, invalided. If he
ill treats such fine fellows as you and
me, and goes unpunished, how will he
treat them, do you think? I'll tell
you what. All I fear is, after he has
got a few taps, he'll go down; then
there'll be no getting him up again,
and he'll escape with only half his deserts.
Now that's just what I want
you to prevent."</p>

<p>"Well," said I; "if I am to officiate
as the skipper's friend, of course I
must do him justice. I only tell you
that."</p>

<p>"Very well," said the Major, between
his teeth. "You pick him up;
that's all."</p>

<p>We reached the high bank by
the water's edge, just above the
landing-place. A boat was seen approaching
from the Princess Wilhelmina:
four men pulling, skipper steering.
Captain Gabion addressed the
Major:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what; it won't do
here. First, there isn't room. Secondly&mdash;don't
you see?&mdash;when he gets
more than he likes, he has nothing to
do but to roll down the bank, jump
into the boat, and shove off. Thirdly,
the boat's crew might interfere; and
then we should get the worst of it."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the boat reached the
jetty; the skipper landed; ascended
the bank by a zigzag path with Snowball
at his heels; passed without
noticing us, as we stood among other
lookers on; and walked up the passage.
The Major followed him.
Captain Gabion and I followed the
Major.</p>

<p>Just as the skipper was emerging
from the passage into the street, the
Major stepped smartly after him, and
tapped him on the shoulder, exclaiming,
"Take that, you ruffian." <em>That</em>
was a sharp application of the toe.</p>

<p>Like a caged lizard touched in the
tail, the skipper sprang fiercely round.</p>

<p>"What's that for?" he cried, with
a furious look.</p>

<p>"Ah, what's that for?" replied the
Major, administering a stinging soufflet.</p>

<p>The skipper, calm in an instant, and
savage in cold blood, commenced
peeling. I stepped up to him, received
his jacket, and handed it to the nigger,
thereby installing myself in office.
The Major turned up the cuffs of his
coat-sleeves.</p>

<p>"Now, coolly, my man," said I, as
the skipper went in like a mad bull.</p>

<p>The first three rounds, like the
Three Graces, had a mutual resemblance.
Superior to the Major in
weight and strength&mdash;formidable, too,
as a hitter&mdash;the skipper did not succeed
in planting a single effective
blow. Some were stopped, some were
dodged, some fell short, and one or
two hit short. Still worse for the
skipper, he had no idea of guard.
His antagonist, a first-rate <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">artiste</i>,
went on gradually painting his portrait.
At the end of the third round,
"his mammy wouldn't a' knowed
him." The Major, in striking, did
not throw in his weight, merely hit
from the shoulder and elbow. But
his punishing told: he hit with a
snap; he hit fast; he had the faculty
of rapidly hitting twice with the same
hand. In short, the skipper was evidently
getting the worst of it. All
this time, the Major continued perfectly
cool and fresh; and, like Shelton,
the navigator&mdash;whom I remember
well, though you, perhaps, do not&mdash;as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
often as he stopped a hit, he politely
inclined his head, as much as to say,
"Well intended&mdash;try again." At the
close of the third round, however, in
consequence of the skipper's attempting
a rush, the Major was constrained
to put in a really hard blow as a stopper.
It not only answered that purpose,
but nearly lifted the skipper,
and sent him reeling some paces backwards.</p>

<p>Instead of coming, as before, to my
extended arms, and seating himself,
like a good child, on my knee till time
was up, the skipper now staggered
towards Snowball, and began rummaging
in his jacket. I was too quick
for him. Just as he extracted an
enormous clasp-knife, I whipped it
out of his hand, and passed it to Captain
Gabion. On this demonstration,
supposing that "legitimate war" was
at an end, and my "occupation gone,"
I was quietly walking away, with my
hands in my pockets. But the Captain,
having first communicated with
the Major, met and stopped me, saying,
"Come, we overlook that. The
next round."</p>

<p>The fourth round presented no novelty.
The painting went on; I may
say, this time, was pretty well finished.
Never was an ugly monkey more completely
"beautified" than the poor skipper.
He still had his strength and wind,
and there was as yet no reason why
he should not ultimately win&mdash;especially
as he hit out like the kick of a
horse, and one of his blows, if it told,
might have turned the day. I began,
however, to be apprehensive that he
would soon be put <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, by
losing the use of his peepers. When,
therefore, I sent him in the fifth time,
I whispered, "You must try to close,
or you'll have the worst of it."</p>

<p>Suddenly rushing in, giving his
head, and boring on with his right
arm extended, the skipper, at the
commencement of the fifth round,
contrived to get his left about the
Major's waist. This led to a grapple,
and a short but fierce struggle. The
skipper had the advantage in physical
power; but the Major was his superior
in wrestling, as well as in the
nobler science. They fell together,
the Major uppermost. On the ground,
strength resuming its advantage, the
skipper soon rolled the Major over,
and had the ascendency. Supposing
the round concluded, I was going to
pull him off. "Let alone, let alone,"
said the Major; "leave him to me."
The Major, I presumed, was waiting
an opportunity for a "hoist."</p>

<p>The skipper now, with his right arm
extended, held the Major's extended
left, pinned down by the wrist. The
skipper's left arm and shoulder were
passed under the Major's right, so as
completely to put it out of commission.
With his left hand, the skipper
seemed to be pulling the Major's hair.
All this was so completely <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors des
règles</i>, that nothing but the Major's
veto kept us from interposing.</p>

<p>At this juncture of the combat
there was evidently something out of
the usual course, which particularly
interested the nigger. Stooping down
almost to a squat, his face peering
close over the heads of the two combatants,
his big eyes bulging and
gloating with eager expectation, his
mouth open, his blubber lips projecting,
and his two hands uplifted and
expanded with intense curiosity, he
watched the result. Just in time, I
grasped the skipper's thumb! Half a
second more, and the Major's eye
would have been out of its socket!</p>

<p>Captain Gabion, breathing the only
execration I ever heard from his lips,
choked the skipper off.</p>

<p>The Portuguese bystanders, though
much interested in the fray, had not
been thoroughly sensible of its character.
To them, probably, the fight had
looked as if a man, in perfect possession
of his temper, had been merely
playing with a very savage assailant,
so clean and easy was the Major's
style of punishing. But now, when
they walked up, and looked in the
miserable sufferer's face, they perceived
the serious nature of the castigo
administered. Instead of features
they beheld&mdash;a mask, I was going to
say, but that would be incorrect; for
in most masks, you have eyes, nose,
and mouth. Here, distinctness was
obliterated; and as to eyes, why, you
couldn't see the eyelashes. I handed
the skipper to Snowball, advising he
should be taken on board, and seen to.
Snowball walked of, conducting him
down the passage. I thought of the
knife, procured it from the Captain,
ran, and handed it to the nigger.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
"Tell him," said I, "never to use
that again, except for cheese-toasting,
picking his teeth, and so forth." "Yes,
massa; me tell him you say so." "I
say, Snowball," added I, "hadn't you
better put a little oil on his face, to
keep off the mosquitos? If they get
at him as he is now, they'll drive him
mad." "Ah no, massa," said Blackey,
regretfully; "no muskitto here, dis
tree, five week; dis place too cold,
mosh very. Let alone, no muskitto
on de wottah here, nebber at no
time."</p>

<p>I hurried back, and found Captain
Gabion supporting the Major, who
stood with both hands spread out over
his right eye, and, to all appearance,
suffering intense agony. Blood was
visible between his fingers, and on his
cheek. The Captain, solicitous to
ascertain the amount of injury, made
a gentle attempt to withdraw the
Major's hands.</p>

<p>"Don't! don't!" gasped the Major.
"Has he&mdash;got my eye&mdash;in his
pocket?"</p>

<p>"All right, all right," replied the
Captain; "you have still a spare eye
to wink with. Near thing, though."</p>

<p>"To-night I meant to have slept at
Villa Franca," said the Major, still
speaking as if his agony was extreme.
"My man is waiting just by with the
horses, at the <em>chafriz</em>."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense!" said Captain
Gabion; "to-night you must
sleep at our quarters. Pledget is there,
and will look at your eye. Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;,
there's the <em>chafriz</em>; that stone fountain,
where you see the open space."</p>

<p>I stepped in that direction, and
found an English servant, holding two
horses. The Major had intended to
"polish off" the skipper, mount forthwith,
and away for Sacavem at a
hand-gallop. So he might; only that
the skipper, according to his own ideas
of manly combat, having got his opponent
undermost, and secured a grip of
the Major's love-lock with his four
fingers, had hooked his thumb-nail,
and eke a portion of his thumb, in the
&mdash;&mdash;but enough. I brought up the
man and horses, and with some difficulty
we got the Major to the hotel.</p>

<p>Pledget was there, examined the eye,
did not consider the injury serious, but
deferred giving any decided opinion.
Ordered the Major to bed, and prescribed
leeches: wanted to apply a
poultice, but the patient couldn't bear
the pressure. For a few days he remained
a prisoner. After that, I met
him in the streets with a green shade&mdash;eye
doing well. Next spring, saw him
on duty. No damage was then visible,
save and except a small scar at
the inner corner of the eye.</p>

<p>How soon, or how slowly, the
skipper recovered from his polishing
I never learned. The skipper, it
appears, a year or two before the
American war broke out, had put into
the Tagus in a vessel from New
Orleans, damaged. She was detained
for repairs; and he, not liking an idle
life, had procured employment in a
Falmouth ship. After the war commenced,
he chose to continue in the
packet line. The exact nature of his
offence, offered to the Major, I never
ascertained. But it was something
connected with the pumping of bilge-water,
when the Major was suffering
from sea-sickness, prostrate on the
deck. Some years after, I heard of
the skipper again. He had left Falmouth,
and had obtained the command
of a packet running between
Southampton and the coast of France.
He still had a bad name for insulting
and ill-treating his passengers; and,
what is curious, he again received a
polishing from an English officer, at
Dieppe. On this occasion, if I mistake
not, the operator was an officer
of the engineers. Whether said officer
came out of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mêlée</i> a Cyclops&mdash;the
little dog forgot to mention.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER VIII.</h3>

<p>The morning after our landing from
the packet, I sought out, and with
some difficulty discovered, my uncle's
office; where I was very cordially
received by both uncles, and very
politely by the other gentlemen of the
department. I announced myself
prepared to start forthwith for headquarters;
fully expecting to be off that
night, or next day at latest. Uncle
No. 1 told me I must go home with
him to dinner, and see my aunt and
cousins. Uncle No. 2 advised me to
look out for a billet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>All this sounded ominous. The
sympathising reader is already advised,
that my progress from Lisbon
to headquarters was not quite so
expeditious as I had anticipated. The
cause of the delay was this.</p>

<p>My dear mother, as I have already
related, had overruled all objections to
my joining the Peninsular army; and
through her influence, my honoured
father gave his reluctant consent.
Shortly after, he was ordered to sea:
his ship left the Downs; and he did
not return, till after my departure
from England. As the time of my
departure drew nigh, my dear mother,
left to her own cogitations, began to
view the subject in a very different
light. In short, she was perfectly
frightened at her own act; and, when
it came to the last, wrote off, without
my knowledge, a letter to my uncle
No. 2, entreating him by all means to
detain me at Lisbon, not for the world
to send me up the country&mdash;in short, to
keep me far beyond the sound, let
alone the range, of hostile cannon.
Her letter, posted at Deal the very
day I started thence for London, came
out to Lisbon by the same conveyance
with myself; and was doubtless in
my uncle's hands, when I presented
myself at the office. Many years
after, in looking over some old correspondence,
I found a letter of hers to
my father at sea, revealing the whole
plot.</p>

<p>Next morning, I again presented
myself, still expecting to receive my
orders, and be off slick to headquarters.
Uncle No. 2 was there; hoped I had
not been <em>much</em> tormented with bugs
and fleas; pointed out a desk with a
high seat; and informed me&mdash;that
was my place!</p>

<p>The scene, which would have instantly
appalled the whole department,
had I given expression to my feelings,
was happily prevented by one reflection,
which struck me just in time;
viz., that I was now an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">employé</i>, bound
to obedience by military law, and
that Nunky was my commanding
officer.</p>

<p>I sulkily took my seat; and Nunky
left me for a few minutes, to the
pleasing process of mental digestion.
Presently, he stood by my side with
a huge bundle of papers:&mdash;laid the
papers on my desk.</p>

<p>"A fortnight," said he, "will probably
elapse ere you can proceed to
headquarters. I wish, in the mean
time, you would just see what you can
do, in arranging these convalescent
accounts. We could not spare a hand
for them, and they have got sadly
into arrear. Do try what you can
make of them."</p>

<p>I went to work;&mdash;worked hard for
a fortnight. At the end of that time,
with occasional directions from my
uncle, the confused mass of accounts
was reduced to something like order.
Still nothing was said about my
journey to headquarters. Fresh work
was given me, which took another
week. I began to get regularly
savage&mdash;was rapidly turning misanthrope&mdash;sympathised
with George
Barnwell. Nunky requested my
company in a private room.</p>

<p>"You came out," said he, "expecting
to go up the country."</p>

<p>"Yes; and on that understanding
I applied for the appointment, as I
expressed in my letter from England.
On that understanding too, unless I
mistook the reply, my services were
accepted."</p>

<p>"Well, G&mdash;&mdash;," said he, "I put it to
yourself. The fact is, those plaguy
convalescent accounts have given us
more trouble than all the business of
the office besides. Till you came out,
we never have had a clerk that could
do them. You do them excellently.
Of course, you are well aware the
public service is the first thing.
The long and the short of it is, you
perform this duty so much to our satisfaction,
your uncle J&mdash;&mdash; and I have
come to the determination&mdash;we must
keep you with us at Lisbon."</p>

<p>This, my dear madam, with the
exception of being crossed in love&mdash;and
to that, you know, we all are
liable&mdash;was my first serious disappointment
in life. Baulked in my
schemes of military glory&mdash;for already,
in imagination, I was a gentleman
volunteer, had mounted a breach, and
won a commission&mdash;I had now but
one remedy; to resign my clerkship,
and return forthwith to England.
And this, under other circumstances,
I should doubtless have done. But
the case, as I then viewed it, stood
thus. Here were my two dear uncles,
with enormous responsibility&mdash;that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
dispensing and accounting for the
whole ready-money transactions of
the Peninsular army; here was one
miserable branch of accounts, which
gave them more trouble than all the
rest; and here was I, the only lad
that could tackle it. Though that, by
the bye, was just so much soft solder;
for there were at least a dozen gentlemen,
in our department, who could
have made up and kept the convalescent
books quite as well as myself,
and probably far better.</p>

<p>Well; bad luck to the shilling.
There was no remedy; so I settled to
my work; devoting my leisure hours,
as a safety-valve, to the furious study
of Portuguese and Spanish. This
blew off my wrath, and in after years
proved of good service.</p>

<p>But I rather suspect, gentle reader,
you're a bloody-minded fellow, and
want to get away without further
bother from Lisbon to the seat of war,
among shot and shells, grape, canister
and congreves. So, cutting it
short, I shall just tell you how, at last,
I out-generalled my dear uncle, and
broke from bondage. After that, if
you've no objection, we'll be off at
once to join the army.</p>

<p>Please to bear in mind, then, that
I was utterly unconscious of any wish
that I should remain at Lisbon, on the
part of my honoured parents, or either
of them. Had I been aware, I would
have acquiesced. My position, according
to the view which I now took
of it, was this. My parents had acceded
to my scheme of joining the
army: my uncles had brought me
out upon that understanding, and
upon no other: and yet, on my arrival,
instead of forwarding me up the
country, had, for no earthly reason
that I could discover, detained me at
Lisbon, to discharge a duty which, it
was now perfectly clear, might quite
as well have been committed to other
hands. This, I say, being my actual
view of the case, you will not think it
strange, that I deemed it perfectly fair
to employ all lawful means for my
own enlargement and emancipation.</p>

<p>An opportunity presented itself, in
the early part of 1814. The Allied
army was now in the Pyrenees and
south of France. Convoys of specie
had been, from time to time, despatched
to headquarters; and were
always accompanied by a clerk or
conductor of our department, who
went in charge. While headquarters
remained in Portugal, or were not far
advanced into Spain, this duty was
considered an agreeable change, and
was rather sought than shunned. But,
as the distance lengthened, the departmental
view of the subject became
different. The journey was now
tedious, and began to be deemed unsafe.
Reports occasionally reached
us of British officers ill treated, robbed,
or murdered on the road, by our
brave Spanish allies. Our conductors,
who were for the most part natives,
began to be very subject to the fever
of the country. Whenever their turn
came to take the charge of treasure to
headquarters, they were sure to have
it. Well; how could they help that?
You see, it was an <em>intermittent</em> fever.
In this condition of affairs, another
large amount of specie was counted
out, packed, and all ready for remittance:
and&mdash;no conductor being forthcoming&mdash;one
of my fellow-clerks received
directions to make the usual
preparations for attending it to headquarters.
Obeyed, as a matter of
course; but didn't like it at all. Communicated
to me his secret sorrows&mdash;was
really far from strong&mdash;would
much prefer remaining at Lisbon.
My determination was taken: I volunteer,
as his substitute. Proposed my
plan, to which he assented with
hilarity.</p>

<p>Still, there, was need of management.
Had I spoken to Nunky in
private, I knew full well I should be
foiled. Combining persuasion with
authority, he would discourage the
scheme, and I should have no course
but acquiescence. So, waiting till
office-hours, I took my usual place,
expecting his appearance in the great
room, where half-a-dozen of us were
seated together at our desks.</p>

<p>His step was heard in the passage.
Half-a-dozen tongues ceased to wag,
and half-a-dozen pens went hard to
work, while half-a-dozen noses came
into close contiguity to half-a-dozen
official documents. Nunky entered,
took his seat, and commenced the
perusal of a pile of letters. I stood
beside him.</p>

<p>"Well, G&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I believe, sir, Mr N&mdash;&mdash; has received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
instructions to prepare for a
journey to headquarters. Not being
in very good health, he would be glad,
with your permission, to remain at
Lisbon. I therefore beg leave to
offer myself as his substitute."</p>

<p>Nunky gave me a look:&mdash;saw at
once that he was beat. In private,
he might have urged his objections:
but, before the whole office, he could
not appear to dissuade me from taking
my turn at a duty, now considered
anything but agreeable. No course,
then, remained for him, but to signify
his consent. "Oh, very well," said
he, "if that's the way you've settled
it between yourselves. Of course, <em>I</em>
can have no objection. Get the usual
advance, then; draw your allowance
for a mule; and have all
ready for starting the day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>Exchanging winks with my fellow-subs,
right and left, I returned triumphant
to my seat. Nunky remained
a few minutes at his desk, evidently
in a little bit of a fidget. How could
I tell that, do you think, when I sat
with my back to him? Oh, I suppose
you never were a clerk in a public office.
Else you wouldn't require to be
informed, that office-clerks have eyes
in the back of their heads. When the
governor is present, his actions, each
and all, are seen and chronicled by
every subordinate in the room. And
a great relief it is, let me tell you, to
the tedium of public business, to recount,
criticise, and dramatise them,
the moment he's off. Nunky took up
a letter, and began to read it&mdash;laid it
down unread&mdash;took up another&mdash;rose
from his seat&mdash;sat down again&mdash;put
on his hat&mdash;and bolted.</p>

<p>Dicky Gossip&mdash;a Portuguese clerk
commonly so called&mdash;rushed forthwith
to the front office, and returned with
equal rapidity. "Ah, Mister Y&mdash;&mdash;,
you is doane. You no sall go up to
de coantree deece toim. Your oankle
I vos see him git into him coashe.
Ah, him, gallop down de treet, faster
as four mules can carry him. Ah,
Mister Y&mdash;&mdash;, I sall tell you vot!"</p>

<p>In the course of the afternoon, I received
a message to attend my uncle
in another apartment. He met me
with a look of triumph, which, I
feared, boded no good.</p>

<p>"Well, G&mdash;&mdash;," said he, "I wish
you had mentioned that business this
morning in private. Then, you know,
we would have talked it over together.
As, however, you chose to tender
your services in the public room,
of course I was forced to view the
thing officially, and there's no remedy
for it. You have volunteered for
headquarters, and to headquarters
you must go."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir! thank you.
That's just what I always wished."</p>

<p>"Just what you always wished?
Of course I know that, as well as you
can tell me, Mr G&mdash;&mdash;. Happy to
say, though, I have effected one arrangement,
which will make matters
far safer, and more agreeable too."</p>

<p>"I fear, sir, if you send me off
without the treasure, you will have
some difficulty&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, G&mdash;&mdash;; you and the
treasure will go together; that of
course. But the fact is, I've been
thinking those Spanish fellows behave
so ill, I'm hardly justified in forwarding
so large an amount of specie by
land, all the way from Lisbon to the
Pyrenees. In short, since you spoke
to me this morning, I have been on
board the flag-ship&mdash;seen the admiral.
You and the treasure go to Passages
in a frigate. Beautiful vessel&mdash;passed
under her stern in coming
ashore."</p>

<p>Alas, my object, then, was only half
effected! I was to join the army, but
not to travel through Spain. Nunky
saw my chagrin and chuckled.</p>

<p>"Come, come, Mr G&mdash;&mdash;," said
he, "you beat me this morning; now
I've beat you. So make up your
mind to a voyage by his Majesty's
frigate the M&mdash;&mdash;. Be quick with
your arrangements, for she's prepared
to sail at a moment's warning.
We shall ship the treasure instanter.
So everything is ready, when you
are."</p>

<p>The next day, at noon, I stood on
the deck of the M&mdash;&mdash;, a silent and
admiring spectator of a grand, peristrephic
panorama, as we glided down
the Tagus under easy sail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p>No occurrence worthy of record signalised
our voyage from Lisbon to
Passages. As you are a member of
the Yacht Club, though, and passionately
fond of romantic scenery, follow
my advice, and treat yourself, some
fine week in the summer, to a run
along the north coast of Spain&mdash;say
from Cape Finisterre to the mouth of
the Bidassoa. By the bye, hadn't you
better reverse it? An awkward thing
you'd find it, to catch an on-shore
wind at the head of the Bay of Biscay.
What would become of you&mdash;ah,
and what would become of that
clever little craft of yours, the Water
Wagtail, with her dandified rig, and
her enormous breadth of beam, and
her six pretty little brass popguns as
bright as candlesticks, should a stiff
north-wester surprise you on that horrid
coast? Won't it be better, then,
to secure some safe roadstead&mdash;the
Gironde for instance&mdash;make that your
starting-point; choose your weather;
and, coasting along the shores of Biscay
and Asturias, have the pleasure of
feeling that you are running out of
the Bay, and not running into it?</p>

<p>That I leave to you. But depend
upon it, if you visit that coast, you
will see not merely rocks, not merely
mountains, not merely wild scenery;
but scenery so peculiar in character,
that you will not easily find the like.
Such was the scenery which, on a fine
day towards the beginning of March,
1814, I viewed one morning early,
standing by the side of the Hon. Mr
Beckenham, third lieutenant of the
M&mdash;&mdash;. Mr B., having the morning
watch, and thinking it dull alone, had
persuaded me to turn out, long, long
before breakfast;&mdash;as he said the night
before, "to view that magnificent
coast at daybreak;" but, as he obligingly
informed me when I came on
deck, "that he might enjoy the pleasure
of my agreeable society."</p>

<p>The scene, at a first glance, rather
disappointed my expectations. "Stupendous
ridge of mountains those Santillanos,
though," said Mr B.; "equal,
I should think, to the Pyrenees themselves&mdash;of
which, in fact, they are a
continuation, though some maps of
Spain don't show it."</p>

<p>The view, as I viewed it, had a
threefold character. <em>First</em>, there was
the coast itself; a black line, occasionally
diversified with specks of
white; this line a ledge of rocks, extending
along shore as far as the eye
could reach, both east and west. The
ocean-swell, incessantly rolling in,
though the morning was still, thundered
on this eternal sea-wall: and
the surf, of which, at our distance, the
eye distinguished nothing but those
white specks, visible from time to
time, presented, when viewed with a
glass, every conceivable variety and
vagary of breaking waves: the foam
now rushing up some sloping shelf,
like troops storming a breach; now
arched sublime in a graceful curve,
that descended in a smoking deluge of
spray; now shooting vertically to a
columnar height, as though the breaker
had first dashed downwards into some
dark abyss, and then, reverberated,
flew sky-high in a pillar of froth. Beyond
this line of rocks, appeared, <em>secondly</em>,
a ridge of low hills, presenting
nothing very remarkable, either in
aspect or in outline. And beyond
these again, further up the country,
appeared, <em>thirdly</em>, a very respectable
and loftier range&mdash;mountains, if
you're a Lincolnshire man, and choose
to call them so.</p>

<p>"So, this is your ridge of mountains,"
said I. "Stupendous? I
don't call twelve or fourteen hundred
feet stupendous, anyhow. And I'm
inclined to think you might look down
on most of them, at that altitude."</p>

<p>"You don't see them," said he.
"You are looking at the coast range.
Do you perceive nothing beyond?"</p>

<p>"Nothing but a few light clouds,"
said I, "in the sickly blue of the
morning sky."</p>

<p>"Well, look at them," replied Mr.
B. "View those clouds attentively.
Watch whether they change their
shape, as clouds usually do, when
seen near the horizon."</p>

<p>I watched, but there was no visible
change. The clouds were fixtures!
Sure enough, those faint, pale streaks
above the hills, that gleamed like
aerial patches of silver vapour, were
no other than the lofty summits of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the distant Santillanos, capped with
snow, and touched by the beam of
early morning. It was worth a turnout,
any day.</p>

<p>Well, at length we reached Passages.
Night had closed in, before we
dropped our anchor off the harbour's
mouth. The captain dreaded the very
disaster to which I have already
alluded, that of being caught by an on-shore
wind in that ugly corner. It was
settled, therefore, that a boat should
be sent at once to announce our arrival,
and the treasure landed next morning
early, in order that the frigate might
be off with the least delay possible.</p>

<p>Next morning early, then, the treasure&mdash;dollars
packed in boxes, one
thousand dollars in a bag, two bags
in a box&mdash;was brought up from the
hold, and stowed in three boats alongside.
Making my best bow to the
captain, and tendering both to him
and to his staff, my sincere and grateful
acknowledgments for all the polite
attentions, &amp;c., I stepped over the
side, and seated myself in the boat
destined for my conveyance. In the
largest boat, which also contained
the largest portion of the treasure, sat
the Hon. Mr Beckenham; in the
next was a middy; in my own, which
was the smallest, were only about
half-a-dozen boxes, and four sailors
to pull ashore. Mr B. requested me
to steer. We pulled for the mouth of
the harbour, which was distinguishable,
at the distance of a mile, by an
abrupt and narrow cleft, dividing two
lofty hills; and by a line of foam,
which extended right across the
entrance, without any visible opening.</p>

<p>Three boats leaving the ship in
company, there was a race of course.
Mine was astern, having been brought
close alongside for my accommodation,
and so getting the last start.
The race was commenced by middy,
who, by the rules of the service, ought
to have kept astern of Mr B., and
therefore tried to get ahead of him.
My men, seeing the contest, began
pulling like mad; and, though outnumbered
by the crew of the other
boats, yet ours being light, and the
weather moderate, soon overtook and
passed them. We pulled away, maintaining
the lead, till a dull roar, like
continued thunder, reminded us that
we were just upon the bar. There it
was, right ahead, crossing our course,
not a hundred yards distant, and no
passage perceptible; the sea, elsewhere,
comparatively tranquil, there
swelling and raging, like a mild-tempered
man in a passion; the breakers
curling, flouncing, tumbling one over
the other, rolling in opposite directions,
tilting as they crossed, and flying
up with the force of the shock.
How were we to pass? or by what
dodge to give the go-by? My men,
excited by the race, would have led
at that moment into Charybdis. Still
they pulled, onward, onward, to all
appearance right upon the reef. The
difficulty was solved, like many other
difficulties, just when we got into the
thick of it. The reef, single in appearance,
was in reality double; that is
to say, it consisted of two ledges, one
ledge overlapping the other: so that,
just at the instant when three strokes
more of the oars would have taken us
into the midst of the tumblification, a
narrow opening, with comparatively
smooth water, appeared at our left; a
turn of the rudder brought us cleverly
round into that friendly channel, and
the next moment we floated on the
tranquil surface of the outer harbour.
The luff-tackle and the reefer, as if
they had let me go ahead only to see
how a landsman could turn a corner,
now seemed disposed to renew the
race. Raising a shout, which rang
from hill to hill in the cleft of that
narrow roadstead, their crews gave
way again with redoubled ardour.
But, having gained the precedence
outside, we easily kept it in smooth
water, and led in, with a sweep,
through the larger harbour to the
town. There, as we coasted along, I
noticed a little jetty; and on it, in
the full uniform of our department, a
little man, who was anxiously watching
our approach. I laid my boat alongside,
jumped ashore, and received a
hearty welcome from Mr Deputy-Paymaster-General
Q&mdash;&mdash;, whom I had previously
known at Lisbon, and who was
now in charge of the military chest at
Passages. Another individual whom
I had met at Lisbon, a gentleman
holding office in a department attached
to the army&mdash;suppose, for want of a
better name, we call him "My Friend"&mdash;stepped
up at the same time, as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
had come by accident, was amazingly
glad to see me, took my hand, and
greeted me with many smiles&mdash;begged
I wouldn't think of troubling myself
about a billet&mdash;his quarters were quite
roomy enough for two. Had I a mule?
Shouldn't be able to get one in all
Passages. Must have something. He
would sell me a pony cheap.</p>

<p>A working party was at hand, to
convey the boxes of specie from the
jetty to the office, which was established
hard by, for the convenience of
landing remittances that came by sea.
A guard was now set, and the sailors
turned to, handing the boxes smartly
out of the boats, and ranging them on
<em>terra firma</em>; the shore party began
conveying them from the jetty into
the office. The Hon. Mr Beckenham
was in a dreadful fuss to get back to
the frigate. "The skipper wants to
be off while the wind is fair, and the
men haven't breakfasted,"&mdash;nor had
he. Up came my commanding officer
just at the moment, and hoped Mr B.
and the middy would favour us with
their company to breakfast, as soon
as the boxes were stowed.</p>

<p>Mr B. glanced circularly at the
horizon, looked at the clouds, looked
at the flags in the harbour, looked at
the clouds again. "Don't think
there's any sign of a change of wind
at present," said he. "Blows very
steady from the south, sir," said the
middy. The boxes were housed; they
suffered themselves to be persuaded,
and walked with us into the office.
"My friend" also received an invite,
and came in company.</p>

<p>The men in the boats were supplied
with bread, butter, and cheese; some
enormous Spanish sausages, by way
of a relish, delicious Spanish onions,
as mild as an apple, and a handsome
allowance of brilliant draught cider.
By all means ship a barrel, if you
touch at Passages in the Water Wagtail.
Mr Q&mdash;&mdash; conducted us to his
private apartment, where we found a
substantial breakfast awaiting us. I
walked into the balcony, which looked
towards the water; took a view of the
men in the boats. All had their
knives out, each sat in an attitude of
his own, the cider evidently gave
general satisfaction, the prog was
rapidly disappearing, and the subject
of conversation was twofold&mdash;the
race, already accomplished, from the
frigate to the jetty; and the race, soon
to come off, from the jetty to the frigate.
"My friend" stood at my
elbow, saw me laughing at Jack,
laughed himself&mdash;laughed heartily.
"When will you come and look at
the pony?" said he. Mr Q&mdash;&mdash; summoned
us to breakfast.</p>

<p>Breakfast over, the lieutenant and
his aide-de-camp took their leave. I
went to look after my baggage, of
which "my friend" had taken charge
in the hurry of landing, promising to
see it stowed with the treasure, where
it would be under a guard. There
was the guard, and there was the
treasure; but there, was not my baggage.
Found him&mdash;demanded an explanation.
"Why, to tell the truth,
the working party being there, he had
embraced the opportunity, and had
sent off my things at once to his own
billet. We might as well go there at
once. Could look at the pony by the
way." Just as we started, my commanding
officer called after me, "Mr
Y&mdash;&mdash;, I shall want you to give me a
few particulars respecting the treasure.
You may as well do so before
going out. Then you may consider
yourself at liberty for the rest of the
day." I accompanied him into a small
room, on the door of which was
wafered "Private." "My friend"
waited outside, in the street.</p>

<p>"Did you send any message to that
gentleman last night," said Mr Q&mdash;&mdash;,
"when the boat came ashore from the
frigate?"</p>

<p>"None whatever, sir. I didn't
even know he was at Passages."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he aware that you were
coming from Lisbon?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how he could be, sir.
For it wasn't mentioned there till the
day before I sailed; and of course no
intelligence could have come in that
time by land."</p>

<p>"Then he didn't meet you this
morning by appointment?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, sir. The meeting
was quite casual."</p>

<p>"Casual? He was waiting about
here for an hour before you landed;
running into the office, out of the
office, poking his nose into every corner&mdash;couldn't
think what he wanted.
Oh, I suppose he must have fallen in
with the second lieutenant yesterday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
evening. That's how he heard of you,
no doubt. Old cronies, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir. We met twice at
Lisbon. That's all that I ever saw
of him, till this morning."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Well, he seems very
attentive. Does he appear to have
any object? What was he saying to
you in the balcony?"</p>

<p>"Said something about a pony he
wants to sell. That was all, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr Q&mdash;&mdash;. The "oh"
came out something like a groan a
yard long, first forte, then minuendo,
with the forefinger applied laterally
to the apex of the nose, and one eye
sapiently half-closed. "Ay, ay; I
see. That's what he's after, no doubt;
he wants you to buy Sancho. Well,
perhaps you can't do better. I know
the pony well. Doubt whether you'll
find anything else to suit you in all
Passages. A mule, indeed, would
answer your purpose better; but the
price of mules is enormous. Have
you drawn your allowance for a horse?"
"No, sir. As I came by water, and dollars
are cumbersome, I thought it best
to defer that till I reached Passages."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well; it's all right, then.
Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;, I feel it my duty to say this
to you; let me know before you close
the bargain. Till then, the eighty
dollars are as well in my hands as in
yours. Horses will soon be dog-cheap.
Few to be had in Spain for
love or money; lots, though, in
France. Once at headquarters, you
may mount yourself <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>; and
the pony will do well enough to carry
you up. Well, Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;, with regard
to quarters, the town is so full, I was
thinking we must try and accommodate
you here. But as Mr what's-his-name
has made the offer, I feel it
my duty to say this to you&mdash;you had
better accept it."</p>

<p>"Will you look at the invoice of
the treasure, now, sir? Or shall I
bring it to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"Show it me now. Any gold?"</p>

<p>"All silver, sir; dollars, half-dollars,
and quarters."</p>

<p>"What's this? Eight bags of a
thousand, halves; twelve bags, quarters;
five bags, small mixed. Why,
it will take us an age to count it all."</p>

<p>"My fingers were sore with counting,
before I left Lisbon, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes; and they must be sore again,
before you leave Passages. Glad to
find you have had practice, though.
Shouldn't mind the dollars: a middling
hand, you know, can count his
thirty thousand a-day; but that small
mixed takes no end of time. Well,
Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;, I feel it my duty to say this
to you&mdash;hold yourself in readiness to
start for headquarters, in charge of
treasure, this day week at latest. If
I can get you off a day or two earlier,
all the better. But the money must
be counted; the boxes must be looked
to and repaired. And then the mules&mdash;why,
you'll want sixty at least. Let
me see. Nearer eighty, unless I can
take part of the silver, and give you
doubloons. Well, I'll see old Capsicum
in the course of the morning, and
ascertain what mules he can let me
have. Be here to-morrow at ten, and
then I shall be able to tell you more
about it."</p>

<p>Delighted to hear once more the
name of Capsicum, and doubting
whether to call on him, or wait till
we met, I was leaving the room to
rejoin "my friend" in the street,
when Mr Q&mdash;&mdash; called me back.</p>

<p>"Of course, you know, Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;,"
said he, "I have no wish to interfere
with a fair bargain. Make your own
agreement for the pony. I have
nothing to say against the party who
wishes to sell, and would be the last
man to disparage a gentleman attached
to any department of the British army.
Only I feel it my duty to say this to
you&mdash;keep your weather-eye open.
Good morning."</p>

<p>"My friend" and I walked off together
to the stable. His Portuguese
servant, Antonio, was in attendance,
led out the pony, walked him, trotted
him, led him in again. The pony, I
thought, was a respectable pony
enough; not in bad condition, neither;
rather small, though, for a rider six
feet high. His legs, supple, well-turned,
and slender, were decidedly
Spanish. But the barrel, round,
bulging, and disproportionably large;
the hum-drum, steady, <em>business-like</em>
pace; the tail, long, thick, and coarse
the drooping neck, the great hairy
ears, the heavy head, the lifeless eye,
and the dull, unmeaning cast of
countenance, betokened rather a Gallic
origin. I declined giving an immediate
answer as to purchasing. "My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
friend," with a laugh, said I was quite
right; and we walked off together to
his billet. "Very dull place, this
Passages," said he. "Shall be happy
to go with you across the harbour,
and show you the market. By the
bye, of course, before you leave, you'll
take a view of St Sebastian. There
stands the poor old town, all knocked
to smash, just as it remained after the
siege. If you wish to form a conception
of the tremendous effect of
cannon-balls, ride over by all means.
You may get there in less than half-an-hour,
upon the pony."</p>

<p>We now reached "my friend's" quarters,
which consisted of one long,
narrow room, with a couple of windows
at the end nearest the street,
and a couple of alcoves at the other,
each alcove containing a very humble
bed. As to the windows, you are
not to understand by the term window,
bless your heart, anything in
the shape of glass, sashes, or window-frame;
but simply a stone opening in
the stone wall, with nothing to keep
out the wind and rain, but a pair of
old clumsy shutters, which were far
from shutting hermetically. The
whole furniture of the apartment consisted
of a ship's stove, borrowed from
one of the transports in the harbour;
a door laid on two trestles, to serve
as a table; and, on each side of the
said table, a bench. Yet often, when
the troops were engaged in active
service, such accommodations as ours
would have been deemed a luxury; and
many a wrangle arose for far worse
quarters. I noticed that the trestles
and benches, which consisted of rough
deal, hastily knocked together, looked
new. This "my friend" explained, by
informing me that the captain of the
transport had lent him his carpenter.
Having seen to my baggage, which
was all right, and ascertained that we
had four hours to dinner, I took the
first opportunity of cutting my stick,
having inwardly formed my determination
to be off at once on foot, and
take a view of St Sebastian. Six or
seven months had now elapsed since
St Sebastian was stormed and taken
by the British and Portuguese forces.</p>

<p>Less than an hour's walk brought
me to the scene of that fierce, and,
for a period, doubtful conflict. The
road was closed up by hills, which
afforded no opportunity for a prospect;
and not a soul did I meet in the
whole distance. All at once I came
in sight of the battered and demolished
fortress. Imagine a town
knocked to pieces. Imagine this
town suddenly presenting itself to your
view. The road unexpectedly opened
upon a sandy plain, on which rose a
few eminences, called the Chofres,
that had afforded a position for some
of the breaching batteries of the
besiegers; at the extremity of this
plain ran the river Urumea, discharging
itself into the sea; and on
an isthmus, beyond the river, stood
St Sebastian. It stood like a city in
the desert. All was solitude and
desolation. The town, though it
had contained many thousand inhabitants,
at this moment afforded no
visible indication of human residence.
It was not forsaken; yet nothing
could I discover of the tokens which
usually indicate life and activity as
we approach the abodes of men&mdash;on
the road, neither vehicles, nor cattle,
nor human beings. I was alone, and
the city was solitary. No; here, at
my feet, upon the sandy plain, was a
memorial, at least, of man and of his
doings. A rise in the level had been
washed down at its edge by the rains
of winter; and, projecting from the
crumbling bank, appeared the bleached
and ghastly remains of a human
being; doubtless one out of the multitudes
who, having fallen in the
siege, had been consigned to a shallow
and hasty grave. I will not deny
that the sight arrested my steps.
Remember, it was the first victim of
war I had ever looked upon. Nay,
more; it invested the whole panorama
with a new character. I stood, as
it were, surveying a vast cemetery, the
soil now concealing in its bosom the
multitudes who, not long before, had
drenched its surface with their blood.
Entering the town, I did indeed see
before me, as "my friend" had said,
"the tremendous effect of cannon-balls."
Yet that was not the whole:
destruction appeared in a threefold
aspect. The batteries had knocked
houses and defences into rubbish and
dust; the mines had torn up the
works from their foundations; and a
general conflagration had ravaged the
whole town. The scene was sombre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and oppressive. War had now advanced
his pavilion into other lands;
but here had left in charge two vast
and hideous sentinels&mdash;Desolation
and Silence! I passed through some
of the principal streets, in which the
fallen stones had been piled on each
side, to make a thoroughfare; and
walked along the ramparts, where
some of the dead were still visible,
partially covered by fragments of the
ruined masonry. No living creature
did I encounter, save one, a miserable
object, a soldier in the Spanish uniform,
apparently an invalid, recovering
from wounds or sickness. On my
approaching him, he appeared unwilling
to speak or be spoken to. Nor
is it difficult to explain why a Spaniard,
meeting an Englishman on the
walls of St Sebastian, should feel little
disposed for conversation. And so I
visited the place, inspected the fortifications,
and returned to Passages, without
exchanging a word with any one.</p>

<p>"My friend," in honour of my arrival,
had invited a brace of dinner-guests:
one, like myself, a clerk of the military
chest, the other a young hospital
mate. Our dinner was excellent;
Irish stew, a Passages hare, and
an enormous omelet, all cooked by
Antonio; capital draught cider; with
the cheese, two bottles of English
porter as a particular treat; and
Andalusian wine <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad libitum</i>.</p>

<p>I must here say a word on the subject
of Irish stew. A standing dish
at headquarters was that Irish stew.
Amongst the followers of the army
were a number of youths, Spanish and
Portuguese, principally the latter, age
from sixteen to twenty, happy, on the
small consideration of a few dollars
per month, to enter the service of any
Senhor Inglez who would hire them.
Most of the clerks attached to headquarters
had a servant of this description;
and as each clerk was entitled
to draw double rations, the arrangement
was convenient. It was the
chief business of this servant, to
discharge the two very congenial
duties of groom and cook; and no
one was eligible to the office who
could not make Irish stew. "Well,
Pedro, what's for dinner to-day?"&mdash;The
answer was invariable, "Oirish-too."
The ration beef&mdash;it was
generally beef&mdash;was popped into a
saucepan with anything else that
came to hand&mdash;bread, onions, leeks,
potatoes if you could get them, and just
enough water to cover the whole;&mdash;then
stewed. Whatever the ingredients,
still it was "Oirish-too."
Now&mdash;perhaps the idea never struck
you&mdash;the true difference between
English and foreign cookery is just
this: in preparing butcher's meat for
the table, the aim of foreign cookery
is to make it tender, of English, to
make it hard. And both systems
equally effect their object, in spite of
difficulties on each side. The butcher's
meat, which you buy abroad, is tough,
coarse-grained, and stringy; yet
foreign cookery sends this meat to
table tender. The butcher's meat
which you buy in England is tender
enough when it comes home; but
domestic cookery sends it up hard.
Don't tell me the hardness is in the
meat itself. Nothing of the kind: it's
altogether an achievement of the
English <em>cuisine</em>. I appeal to a leg of
mutton, I appeal to a beef-steak, as
they usually come to table; the beef
half-broiled, the mutton half-roasted.
Judge for yourself. The underdone
portion of each is tender; the portion
that's dressed is hard. Argal, the
hardness is due to the dressing, not to
the meat: it is a triumph of domestic
cookery.&mdash;Q.E.D. Well; if time was
short&mdash;say, a meal to be prepared on
coming in from a march, the rations
not issued till three hours after, and
Pedro ordered to "make haste, and
get dinner <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">depressa</i>,"&mdash;why, then, to
appease the wolf in your stomach,
the Irish stew was ready in no time&mdash;boiled
like fury&mdash;dished up in half
an hour. In that case, you got it in
the genuine English style&mdash;done in a
hurry: the broth watery and thin, the
potatoes bullets, and the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouilli</i> shrunk,
indurated, screwed up into tough
elasticity, by the sudden application
of a strong heat, and the potent effect
of hard boiling. Engage a "good plain
cook"&mdash;tell her to boil a neck of
mutton&mdash;that will show you what I
mean. All London necks of mutton
come to table crescents&mdash;regularly
curled. But if, on the contrary, you
were in quarters, or the troops halted
a day, then you got your Irish stew
after the foreign fashion. Breakfast
cleared away, your horse is brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to the door, that you may ride a few
miles forwards, and take a view of the
operations, or ogle Soult through a
telescope. Pedro then commences his
culinary operations forthwith. The beef&mdash;and
what-not besides&mdash;is whipped
into the saucepan; the saucepan is set
among the embers upon the hearth: and
there it stands&mdash;not boiling&mdash;scarcely
simmering&mdash;suppose we say digesting&mdash;throughout
the forenoon, and till
you are ready to eat. Long before
dinner, savoury steams announce a
normal process of the <em>cuisine</em>, a process
both leisurely and effectual. At
length, crowned with laurels, and, like
all heroes, hungry after fighting, you
return from the skirmish in front,
having barely escaped a stray
cannon-ball that made your horse&mdash;oh,
didn't it?&mdash;spin round like a teetotum.
The rich repast awaits you&mdash;the
whole is turned out, and smokes
upon the table&mdash;the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouilli</i> is tender,
the "jus" appetising and substantial,
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout-ensemble</i> excellent. And if,
with an eye to his own interest in the
concern, Pedro has slipped in a handful
or so of garlic, why, you live all
day in the open air&mdash;so it doesn't
much signify.</p>

<p>Well, so much for Irish stew. We
wound up the evening with ship-biscuit
and brandy-and-water&mdash;ration
brandy&mdash;French&mdash;superb. What an
exchange for the horrid <i lang="pt" xml:lang="pt">agoardente</i> of
Lisbon, that excoriated your palate,
indurated your gizzard, and burnt a
hole in your liver! I happened to
mention my morning visit to St Sebastian.
All my three companions had
seen St Sebastian during the siege&mdash;were
present at the storming. "Sorry
I was not ordered up in time," said I.</p>

<p>"You'll never see anything like
that," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Well, can't you tell me something
about it?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied he; "rather too
late for that to-night. I must be
moving."</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen; mix another
tumbler round," said "my friend." "If
we cannot go into particulars, at least,
for the satisfaction of Mr Y&mdash;&mdash;, let us
each relate some one incident, which
we witnessed when the city was taken
by storm. Come, doctor; you shall
begin."</p>

<p>"Really," said the doctor, "it was
such a scene of slaughter and confusion,
I can hardly recollect anything
distinctly enough to tell it. I got into
the town almost immediately after
the troops, to look after the wounded;
just those that required to be operated
on at once. Found my way into a
by-street; came among some of our
fellows, who were carrying on such a
game, drinking, plundering, firing at
the inhabitants, and I don't know
what-all besides, I was glad enough
to escape with my life, and got out of
the place as fast as I could. Don't
really remember any particular occurrence
to relate. Oh, yes; just as I
was coming away, I saw one old
woman&mdash;beg pardon; ought to have
said elderly gentlewoman&mdash;pinned to
a post with a bayonet, for defending
her daughter's virtue."</p>

<p>Well, gentlemen, said "my friend,"
"I also will relate an incident, connected
with that dreadful day. But,
first of all, I must show you something.
What, would you say, is the
value of that, doctor?" He produced
a very handsome diamond ring.
"Worth fifty dollars at least," said
the doctor, holding it to the lamp.
"I say, <em>worth</em> it; that is, in the trade.
Would sell, in Bond Street, for more
than double that price, as they'd set it
in London." The doctor, I should mention,
was the son of a fashionable watchmaker&mdash;bore
the sobriquet of Tick.</p>

<p>"Well," continued my friend,
"how do you think I became possessed
of that ring? Just after the town
was carried, I watched a lull in the
firing from the castle, and went in
over the breach. Only one or two
round-shot fell, as I was climbing up.
Met there an English sailor, a man-of-war's
man, coming along in high good
humour, perhaps a little the worse
for liquor. He was shouting, laughing,
holding up his two hands, as if he
wanted me to look at them. The
fellow had been plundering; plundering
a jeweller's shop. "Now I'm dressed
out for a ball," said he, "all for one
like a Spanish lady." What d'ye
think he had done? All his fingers,
both hands, were covered down to the
tips with splendid rings, rings set
with precious stones, as thick as
curtain-rods. Brilliants, rubies,
emeralds, amethysts, he had stuck
them on, one after the other, till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
there was no room left. Told him
I'd buy them: offered him a dollar
for the lot; two dollars; five dollars.
'Avast,' said he, 'I'm a gentleman.
Don't want none of your dumps,
messmate. Shouldn't mind giving you
one, though, for good luck. Here,
take this big un.' It was a great
ugly Brazilian topaz. 'No, no,'
said I; 'give me this little one.' He
gave it me; I thanked him; and he
walked away, laughing and shouting.&mdash;Worth
fifty dollars, you say. Is it
though, doctor? For forty-five down,
you shall have it."</p>

<p>The doctor made no reply; and,
for a few seconds, there was a dead
silence. "Come, Mr Pagador senior,"
said he; "I've got three gunshot
wounds, an ague, and a dysentery.&mdash;Must
see them all, before I go to bed.
Please to proceed."</p>

<p>"I think," said my fellow-clerk,
"our host had a good chance of being
shot, when he mounted the breach;
for the French, I remember, kept up
a fire on all who passed that way,
long after it was carried. You're sure
you got that ring on the breach, are
you?... I, also, had a narrow
escape, after I got into the town.
I was walking up one of the streets,
and passed a wine-shop, where a lot
of our fellows were assembled, within
and without. A few yards beyond
was a corner; another street crossed.
Just at the crossing, in the middle of
the road, lay an English soldier, dead.
There was nothing particular in that;
for I had passed several dead before,
as I came along. Walking on, I
noticed two soldiers looking at me
and talking. 'Better tell him, then,'
said one of them. 'Tell him yourself,'
said the other; 'I shan't tell
him. He's only a commissary.' Just
before I reached the corner, some one
gently laid hold of my arm. I turned
round. It was that officer of the
engineers&mdash;Gabion&mdash;yes, Captain
Gabion. 'Wouldn't advise you to go
beyond the corner,' said he.&mdash;'Why
not?' said I. 'Don't you see that man
lying on the road?' said he.&mdash;'Any
danger?' said I. 'I'll soon let you
see that,' said he: 'have the kindness
to lend me your hat.' I gave him my
hat&mdash;staff-hat&mdash;bought it new at Vittoria.
He stepped forward, held it
out by one end, just poked about half
of it beyond the corner. Crack! a
rifle-bullet came clean through it.
'The French,' said he, 'still occupy
that street. I set a sentry here just
now, to keep people from passing on.
But he's off; plundering, I suppose, or
getting drunk. I'm sorry for your
hat, though.' Rum trick, that of
Captain Gabion's, I must say. I
thought it very unkind. Kept me
from getting shot; much obliged to him
for that. But spoiled my new staff-hat&mdash;cost
me ten dollars."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor, "that's
just what he is; always up to some
practical piece of wit, and grave as a
judge. Grave? I should rather say
melancholy. Such a fellow for joking,
too! Why, he'd crack a joke if a shell
was fizzing at his feet. One of the
coolest officers in the service."</p>

<p>"Where is Captain Gabion now?"
said I.</p>

<p>"Oh, somewhere in advance,"
said the doctor; "you may be sure
of that; somewhere with the troops
in the south of France. He and his
friend, that major of the artillery, had a
narrow escape, though, in the winter.
Must needs go paying a morning visit
to a French family just this side of St
Jean de Luz, before the enemy were
driven across the Nivelle. Just escaped
a party of them by hard riding.
Don't see, though, that your hat, Mr
Pagador, is much the worse, merely
for being pinked."</p>

<p>"It makes people stare so," said
he, "that's all I care about. Looks
just exactly as if one had been shot
through the head."</p>

<p>"Shouldn't mind giving you my
new foraging cap and a dollar for it,"
said "my friend." Again there was a
short silence. It was clear, in fact, that
"my friend's" disposition to barter and
bargain was not altogether admired.</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," said I, "you
have all been good enough to tell me
something about St Sebastian. Now,
I'll tell you something. Did you ever
see a dead man swim?"</p>

<p>"I've seen a dead man float," said
the doctor; "never saw one swim."</p>

<p>"Well, that's what I saw this morning.
And you may see it to-morrow,
if you choose to go and look. I'll tell
you how it was. The tide was up,
and the river Urumea nearly full.
I was standing on that part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
rampart, where, as you know, the
rubbish dislodged by the springing of
the mine is shot down into the bed of
the river. In that vast heap, no
doubt many of the storming party
found a grave, where they still lie
buried, under tons upon tons of shattered
masonry. In some instances,
however, the sufferers were not entirely
overwhelmed by the explosion;
and their remains are still partly
visible, bleached by the sun and wind.
The water was perfectly clear; you
might see the rocks in the bed of
the stream. My eye, measuring the
shattered pile on which I was standing,
mechanically descended from its summit
to its base, which juts out far into
the river. Just under water, I noticed
something in motion. The appearance
attracted my attention. Descending
the mound to the water's edge, what
do you think I saw? A man half
emerging from the fragments, and
swimming, yes, swimming beneath the
surface, striking out with both hands,
as if struggling to get free. So visible
was the object, so distinctly I saw
every movement, my first impulse
was to step down into the water, drag
him out from the rubbish before he
was drowned, and land him on <em>terra
firma</em>. I looked again&mdash;he was long
past drowning. There he had swum,
at high water, every day since the city
was stormed, and the mine was
sprung. His bones, half bared of flesh,
were still held together by the ligaments;
the mine, by its explosion,
had buried him up to the middle; but
from the loins he was free: the play
of the waves tossed him to and fro;
the water, in its flux and reflux, now
caught his arms and spread them out;
from his sides to their full extent, now
brought them back again:&mdash;anybody
would have said it was a man swimming.
Well, I shall dream of it to-night.
I shall again be standing on
that breach before daylight; fancy I
see the dead man swimming out beneath
my feet; and perhaps hear him
calling for help under water. Only
hope I mayn't fancy it's myself."</p>

<p>"It's curious," said the doctor,
"when a fellow first joins, how a thing
of that kind strikes him as remarkable.
Well, good night all."</p>

<h2>AMERICAN ADVENTURE.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>


<p>There is a class of literature
peculiarly American, and unlikely to
be rivalled or imitated to any great
extent on this side the Atlantic, for
which we entertain a strong predilection.
It is the literature of the forest
and the prairie, of the Indian camp
and the backwood settlement, of the
trapper's hunting ground, and, we
now must add, of the Californian
gold mine. It comprises the exploits
and narratives of the pioneer in the
Far West, and the squatter in Texas;
of the military volunteer in Mexico,
and the treasure-seeking adventurer
on the auriferous shores of the Pacific.
In common with millions of Europeans,
we have watched, for years
past, with wonder, if not always with
admiration, the expansive propensities
of that singularly restless people,
who, few in number, in proportion to
their immense extent of territory,
and prosperous at home under the
government they prefer, yet find
themselves cramped and uneasy within
their vast limits, and continually, with
greater might than right, displace
their neighbour's boundary-mark and
encroach upon his land. The mode
in which this has been done, in a
southerly direction, by the settlement
of emigrants, who, gradually accumulating,
at last dispossess and expel
the rightful owner, has been often
described and exemplified; and nowhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
more graphically than by
Charles Sealsfield, in his admirable
<cite>Cabin Book</cite> and <cite>Squatter Nathan</cite>.
The Anglo-German-American, deeply
impressed by the virtues of his
adopted countrymen, and especially
by that intelligence and enterprising
spirit which none can deny them,
sees merit rather than injustice in
the forcible expulsion of the Spaniard's
descendants, and makes out
the best possible case in defence of
the Yankee spoliator. Still, when
stripped of factitious colouring and
rhetorical adornments, the pith of
the argument seems to be that the land
is too good for the lazy "greasers,"
who must incontinently absquatilate,
and make way for better men. As
for Indians, they are of no account
whatever. "Up rifle and at them!"
is the word. In utter wantonness
they are shot and cut down. Let
us hear an American's account of the
process.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"When Captain Sutter first settled in
California he had much trouble with the
Indians, but he adopted, and has pursued
steadily from the first, a policy of
peace, combined with the requisite firmness
and occasional severity. Thus he
had obtained all-powerful influence with
them, and was enabled to avail himself
of their labour for moderate remuneration.
Now all was changed: the late
emigrants across the mountains, and
especially from Oregon, had commenced
a war of extermination, shooting them
down like wolves&mdash;men, women, and
children&mdash;wherever they could find them.
Some of the Indians were undoubtedly
bad, and needed punishment, but generally
the whites were the aggressors; and,
as a matter of course, the Indians retaliated
whenever opportunities occurred;
and in this way several unarmed or
careless Oregonians had become, in turn,
their victims. Thus has been renewed
in California the war of extermination
against the aborigines, commenced in
effect at the landing of Columbus, and
continued to this day, gradually and
surely tending to the utter extinction of
the race. And never has this policy
proved so injurious to the interests of the
whites as in California."&mdash;(<cite>Sights in the
Gold Regions</cite>, p. 152-3.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Johnson illustrates by examples
the system he thus condemns, and
shows us war-parties of white men
issuing forth for <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">razzias</i> upon Indian
villages, receiving, as they depart,
the valedictory benediction of the
patriarch of the settlement, a veteran
backwoodsman, well known in the
Rocky Mountains as a guide and
pioneer, and who, after a long and
adventurous career, has at last located
himself, with his active, reckless, half-breed
sons in the beautiful and romantic
valley of the Saw Mill. This
bloody-minded old miscreant, John
Greenwood by name, boasted of having
shot upwards of a hundred Indians&mdash;ten
of them since his arrival in California&mdash;and
hoped still to add to the
murder-list, although incapacitated
by age from distant expeditions. His
cabin was the alarm-post where the
foragers assembled, and whither, on
their return from their errand of blood
and rapine, they brought their ill-gotten
spoils, the captive squaws, and
the still reeking scalps of their victims.
With male prisoners they rarely troubled
themselves; although, upon one
occasion during Mr Johnson's stay in
their vicinity, they brought in a number,
and shot seven of them in cold
blood, because, "being bad-looking
and strong warriors," it was believed
they had participated in the murder
of five English miners, surprised and
slain a short time previously. Expeditions
of this kind are called "war-parties;"
and the propriety of the system
of which they form a part is as
fiercely and passionately defended by
the Americans in California, as is the
propriety of slave-holding by the free
and enlightened citizens of the southern
states of the Union. It were far
from prudent to preach emancipation
in Florida or Louisiana; at the "diggins"
it is decidedly unsafe to call the
shooting of Indians by the harsh name
of murder. "We saw a young mountaineer,
wild with rage, threaten the
life of an American who had ventured
to suggest that the murders committed
by these Indians were provoked by
many previous murders of the whites,
and that they should not be avenged
by <em>indiscriminate</em> slaughter, but by the
death of the <em>guilty</em>." The horrible
character of the frequent massacres is
aggravated by the adoption, on the
part of the white savages, of the repugnant
and barbarian usages of the
unfortunate heathens whom they first
provoke and then hunt to the death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
by the tearing off of scalps, and suchlike
hideous and unchristian abominations.
Unfortunately, these scenes
of slaughter and atrocity are of constant
occurrence, not only in that far-off
land where gold is to be had for
the gathering, but wherever the white
man and the red come in contact.
The air of the prairie and backwoods
seems fatal to all humane and merciful
feelings, and the life of the Indian is
held no dearer than that of skunk or
buffalo. Mr Parkman tells us of "a
young Kentuckian, of the true Kentucky
blood, generous, impetuous,
and a gentleman withal, who had
come out to the mountains with
Russel's party of California emigrants.
One of his chief objects, as he gave
out, was to kill an Indian&mdash;an exploit
which he afterwards succeeded in
achieving, much to the jeopardy of
ourselves and others, who had to pass
through the country of the dead
Pawnee's enraged relatives." No
censure is passed upon this generous
and gentlemanly young murderer by
Mr Parkman, whose book would
nevertheless indicate him to be a man
of education and humanity, but who
is apparently unable to discern any
moral wrong in wantonly drilling a
hole through the painted hide of a
Pawnee. The system of extermination
seems practically inseparable
from the aggrandisement of American
territory at Indian expense.
When Mexicans are to be ejected,
the process is more humane, or at
least less cold-blooded and revolting
in its circumstances. But, although
the barbarity diminishes, the injustice
is as great. By American annexators
and propagandists, respect of property
may be set down as an Old
World prejudice; still it is one by
which we are contented to abide; and
we cannot see the right of any one to
turn a man out of his house because
he does not keep it in repair and
occupy all the rooms, or to pick a
quarrel with him as a pretext for
appropriating a choice slice of his
garden. A considerable portion of
the people of the United States are
evidently convinced that they are the
instruments of Providence in the
civilisation and population of the
New World, and look forward to the
time as by no means remote when
their descendants and form of government
shall spread south and north, to
the exclusion of British rule and Spanish-American
republics, from Greenland
to Panama. As a preparatory
step, their pioneers are abroad in all
directions; and some of them, being
handy with the pen as well as with
the rifle, jot down their experiences
for the encouragement of their countrymen
and edification of the foreigner.
Before us are three books of the kind
completely American in tone and
language, and of at least two of which
it may safely be affirmed that none
but Americans could have written
them. In fact they are written in
American rather than in English;
particularly Mr Johnson's "Sights,"
of which we can truly say that, but
for our intimate acquaintance with
the language of the United States,
acquired by much study of this particular
sort of literature, we should have
made our way through it with difficulty
without reference to the dictionary,
which we presume to exist, of American
improvements on the English
tongue. The book swarms with Yankeeisms,
vulgarisms, and witticisms;
the latter of no elevated class, and
seldom rising above a very bad pun;
notwithstanding which, <cite>Sights in the
Gold Regions</cite> is a very amusing, and,
to all appearance, a very honest account
of life at the diggings. The other
two books are the work, the one of a
philosopher in the woods, and the other
of a sailor on horseback. Mr Parkman,
who, as regards literary skill, is superior
to either of the companions we
have given him&mdash;although his book has
less novelty and pungency than either
of theirs&mdash;left St Louis in the spring
of 1846, on a tour of curiosity and
amusement to the Rocky Mountains,
with the especial object of studying
the manners and character of Indians
in their primitive state. He has a
good eye for scenery and tolerable
descriptive powers, and some of the
adventures and anecdotes he relates
are striking and interesting. But, for
a fine specimen of rich rough-spun
Yankee narrative, commend us to
Lieutenant Wise of the United States
navy. There is no mistake about the
gallant author of <cite>Los Gringos</cite>. He
makes no more pretence to style or
elegance than a boatswain's mate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
spinning a yarn upon the forecastle.
Despising the trammels of orthography
and probability, sprinkling his comical
English with words from half-a-dozen
other languages (often ludicrously distorted),
sometimes shrewd, frequently
very humorous, invariably good-humoured
and vivacious, this rollicking
naval officer hoists the reader on his
shoulders, and carries him at a canter
through his great thick closely-printed
New York volume, with infinitely less
fatigue to the rider than he himself
experienced when, perched upon a
Spanish saddle, and armed with a whip
"whose lash was like the thongs of a
knout," he urged the sorry posters
along the road to Mexico's capital. In
a few lines of preface, the humorous
lieutenant discloses his plan and gives
us a glimpse of his quality. "The
sketches embodied in this narrative,"
he says, "were all written on the field
of their occurrence: the characters
incidentally mentioned are frequently
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nommes du mer</i>. It is not expected
by the author that even the most charitable
reader will wholly overlook the
careless style and framing of the work,
or allow it to pass without censure;
nor has it been his object to deal in
statistics, or any abstract reflections,
but merely to compile a pleasant narrative,
such as may perchance please
or interest the generality of readers;
and in launching the volume on its
natural element&mdash;the sea of public
opinion&mdash;the author only indulges in
the aspiration, whether the reader be
gentle or ungentle, whether the book
be praised or condemned, that at least
the philanthropy of the publishers
may be remunerated, wherein lies all
the law and the profits." After which
facetious and characteristic preamble,
Lieutenant Wise goes on board his
frigate; is tugged out of Boston harbour,
and sails for Monterey; is alternately
buffeted and becalmed; is in
danger of stranding on the Dahomey
territory and reviles creation accordingly,
but ultimately escapes the peril
and sets foot on shore at Rio Janeiro,
in which pleasant latitude he frequents
the coffee-houses, and partakes
of mint juleps and other cold institutions;
watches the niggers dancing and
jabbering their way along the streets,
with little fingers affectionately interlaced,
and <em>sistling</em> polkas through their
closed teeth; and is somewhat scandalised,
and yet vastly amused, by the
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">samacueca</i>, a South American polka of
much grace but questionable decency,
on beholding which he, Lieutenant
Wise, being, "as an individual, fond
of a taste of cayenne to existence,"
clapped his hands and vociferously
applauded. This eccentric dance,
however, was at Valparaiso, we find&mdash;not
that the fair Brazilians are behind
any of their South American sisters in
the license they accord their supple
forms and twinkling feet. At last,
and in the heat of the war between
Mexico and the States, Lieutenant
Wise reached Monterey, where his
ship cast anchor. California had been
taken possession of by the Americans,
and fighting was going on in the neighbourhood.
Before the war, Monterey
contained about five hundred inhabitants,
but when Mr Wise, arrived,
scarcely a native was to be seen. The
men were away fighting in the southern
provinces, a few women scowled
from their dwellings at the <em>gringos</em>
(the name given to Anglo-Americans
in Mexico and California). Yankee
sentinels were posted, knife in girdle,
and rifle-lock carefully sheltered from
the rain; and persons moving about
after dark were greeted at every turn
with the challenge&mdash;"Look out thar,
stranger!" quickly followed by a bullet,
if they delayed to shout their
name and calling. There was nothing
to be had to eat, drink, or smoke, and
the general aspect of affairs was cheerless
enough. Presently in rode sixty
horsemen, gaunt bony woodsmen of
the Far West, dressed in skins, with
heavy beards and well-appointed
rifles, fellows "who wouldn't stick at
scalping an Indian or a dinner of mule-meat,"
and who belonged to the Volunteer
Battalion, in which they had
enrolled themselves "more by way of
recreation than for glory or patriotism."
They were not easy to understand,
having passed most part of their
lives in the Rocky Mountains, a district
which has its own peculiar phraseology.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We soon became quite sociable, and,
after a hearty supper of fried beef and
biscuit, by some miraculous dispensation
a five gallon keg of whisky was uncorked,
and, after a thirty days' thirst, our new-found
friends slaked away unremittingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Many were the marvellous adventures
narrated of huntings, fightings, freezings,
snowings, and starvations; and one stalwart,
bronzed trapper beside me, finding
an attentive listener, began:&mdash;'The last
time, captin, I cleared the Oregon trail,
the Ingens fowt us amazin' hard. Pete,'
said he, addressing a friend smoking a
clay pipe by the fire, with a half pint of
corn-juice in his hand, which served to
moisten his own clay at intervals between
every puff&mdash;'Pete, do you notice
how I dropped the Redskin who put the
poisoned arrow in my moccasin! Snakes,
captin! the varmints lay thick as leaves
behind the rocks; and, bless ye, the minit
I let fall old Ginger from my jaw, up they
springs, and lets fly their flint-headed arrers
in amongst us, and one on 'em wiped
me right through the leg. I tell yer what
it is, hoss, I riled, I did, though we'd had
tolerable luck in the forenoon;&mdash;for I
dropped two and a squaw, and Pete got
his good six&mdash;barrin' that the darned villains
had hamstrung our mule, and we
were bound to see the thing out. Well,
captin, as I tell ye, I'm not weak in the
jints, but it's no joke to hold the heft of
twenty-three pounds on a sight for above
ten minits on a stretch; so Pete and me
scrouched down, made a little smoke with
some sticks, and then we moved off, a few
rods, whar we got a clar peep. For better
than an hour we see'd nothin'; but on a
suddin I see'd the chap&mdash;I know'd him
by his paintin'&mdash;that driv the arrer in my
hide: he was peerin' round quite bold,
thinkin' we'd vamosed; I jist fetched old
Ginger up and drawed a bee line on his
cratch, and, stranger, I giv him sich a
winch in the stomach that he dropped
straight into his tracks: he did! In five
jumps I riz his har, and Pete and me
warn't troubled again for a week.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>After two months passed at Monterey,
the American squadron assembled
and a new commodore arrived,
whereupon Lieut. Wise's captain was
not sorry to be allowed to lift his anchors,
and avoid playing second fiddle
to the new commander-in-chief by
transferring his pennant to the waters
of the San Francisco. On the way
thither his lieutenant treats us to some
yarns of extraordinary toughness.
Speaking of the lasso, in the use of
which the Californians are particularly
skilful&mdash;catching a bull by the tail and
making him fling a somerset over his
horns, or dragging a grizzly bear for
miles to the baiting place&mdash;he calls to
mind having once seen a troop of
horses "at General Rosas' quinta,
near Buenos Ayres, trained to run
like hares, with fore and hind legs
lashed together by thongs of hide: it
was undertaken to preserve the animals
from being thrown by the Indian
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">bolas</i>, and the riders, as a consequence,
lanced to death. But I was
far more amused one afternoon, when
passing a fandango, near Monterey,
to see a drunken cattle-driver, mounted
on a restive, plunging beast, hold at
arm's length a tray of glasses, brimming
with aguardiente, which he politely
offered to everybody within reach
of his curvettings, without ever once
spilling a drop." These marvellous
feats are nothing, however, compared
to the cannibal exploits of some unfortunate
emigrants, who, having loitered
on their way, were overtaken by
the snow in the Californian mountains,
and compelled to encamp for
the winter. Their provisions and
cattle consumed, even to the last horse
hide, famine and insanity ensued.
Those who starved to death were
eaten by the survivors, whose appetites,
if we may believe Mr Wise,
were quite prodigious. A Dutchman,
he gravely assures us, actually ate a
full-grown body in thirty-six hours;
and another boiled and devoured, in
a single night, a child, nine years of
age. We cannot venture to extract
the revolting details that follow. The
lieutenant's facetiousness upon this
horrible subject is rather ghastly; and
the particulars supplied by a young
Spaniard, who "ate a baby," are
abominable in the extreme, although
possibly true. At least Mr Wise assures
us he had them from the lad's own
lips. And, whilst his strength lasted,
poor Baptiste was drudge to the whole
party, doing his duty well, fetching
fuel and water, until at last, as he
told Mr Wise, "very hungry, sir; eat
anything."</p>

<p>On the wild and dreary track from
the States to California, frightful disasters
occur to caravans of emigrants,
which, encumbered with women and
children, and sometimes under incompetent
leaders, lose precious time by
the way, and are caught and crushed
by the terrible winter of those desolate
regions. Journeying near the
Sacramento, Mr Johnson came upon
the house of "old Keysburg the cannibal,
who revelled in the awful feast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on human flesh and blood, during the
sufferings of a party of emigrants near
the pass of the Sierra Nevada, in the
winter of 1847. It is said that the
taste which Keysburg then acquired
has not left him, and that he often
declares, with evident gusto, 'I would
like to eat a piece of you;' and several
have sworn to shoot him, if he
ventures on such <em>fond</em> declarations to
them. We therefore looked upon the
den of this wild beast in human form
with a good deal of disgusted curiosity,
and kept our bowie-knives handy
for a slice of him if necessary."</p>

<p>Sailor though he is, Mr Wise
troubles his reader very little with
nautical matters. During a few weeks
he was a good deal afloat, having
succeeded to the command of the
Rosita, a forty ton schooner, with a
crew of fifteen sailors, a small boy,
and a mulatto cook, who had once
been "head bottle-washer of a Liverpool
liner, with glass nubs on de
cabin doors;" but otherwise most of
his time seems to have been spent on
shore, riding, shooting, dancing, and
love-making, doing military duty in
garrison at Mazatlan, throwing up
fortifications, and surprising parties
of Mexicans, whose fear of the Gringos
was most intense and ludicrous.
In their civil wars, and when contending
with the Spaniards for their
independence, the Mexicans have
occasionally fought doggedly, although
never skilfully; but when opposed to
combatants of the Anglo-Saxon race,
they have invariably shown themselves
arrant cowards. Although the
soldiers of the States have even less
military discipline than those of
Mexico, the bodily strength, skill
with the rifle, intrepidity, and self-reliance
of the former, would render
them formidable opponents even to
well-drilled European troops. As to
the Mexicans, no matter how great
the numerical odds in their favour,
they never could or would stand
against the hardy Yankee volunteers.
In the summer of 1846, Mr Parkman
met, upon the wild and lonely banks
of the Upper Arkansas, Price's Missouri
regiment, on its way to Santa
Fé.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"No men ever embarked upon a military
expedition with a greater love for
the work before them than the Missourians;
but if discipline and subordination
be the criterion of merit, these soldiers
were worthless indeed. Yet when their
exploits have rung through all America,
it would be absurd to deny that they
were excellent irregular troops. Their
victories were gained in the teeth of
every established precedent of warfare;
they were owing to a singular combination
of military qualities in the men
themselves. Without discipline or a
spirit of subordination, they knew how to
keep their ranks, and act as one man.
Doniphan's regiment marched through
New Mexico more like a band of Free
Companions than like the paid soldiers of
a modern government. When General
Taylor complimented Doniphan on his
success at Sacramento and elsewhere,
the colonel's reply very well illustrates
the relations which subsisted between the
officers and men of his command. 'I
don't know anything of the man&oelig;uvres.
The boys kept coming to me to let them
charge; and when I saw a good opportunity,
I told them they might go. They
were off like a shot, and that's all I
know about it.'</p>

<p>"The backwoods lawyer was better
fitted to conciliate the good-will than to
command the obedience of his men.
There were many serving under him,
who both from character and education,
could better have held command than he.
At the battle of Sacramento, his frontiersmen
fought under every possible disadvantage.
The Mexicans had chosen
their own position; they were drawn up
across the valley that led to their native
city of Chihuahua; their whole front was
covered by intrenchments, and defended
by batteries of heavy cannon; they outnumbered
the invaders five to one. An
eagle flew over the Americans, and a
deep murmur rose along their lines. The
enemy's batteries opened; long they remained
under fire, but when at length
the word was given, they shouted and
ran forward. In one of the divisions,
when midway to the enemy, a drunken
officer ordered a halt; the exasperated
men hesitated to obey. 'Forward, boys!'
cried a private from the ranks; and the
Americans, rushing like tigers upon the
enemy, bounded over the breastwork.
Four hundred Mexicans were slain upon
the spot, and the rest fled, scattering
over the plain like sheep. The standards,
cannon, and baggage were taken, and
among the rest a waggon laden with
cords, which the Mexicans, in the fulness
of their confidence, had made ready for
tying the American prisoners."</p></blockquote>

<p>A curious picture of military <em>un</em>discipline&mdash;of
egregious cowardice on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
the one hand, and fortunate audacity
on the other. It is evident that the
Doniphan mode of carrying on the
war&mdash;consulting the men's pleasure,
with officers drunk before the enemy,
and privates giving the word of command&mdash;however
successful it may
prove against the wretched Mexicans,
or in mountain and guerilla warfare,
would never answer in the open field
against a regular and skilfully commanded
army. The question, then,
follows,&mdash;How far could these staunch
and gallant American riflemen be
trained to the strict discipline and
military exercises and man&oelig;uvres
essential to the efficiency of large
bodies of troops, without impairing
the very qualities, the feelings of
independent action and self-reliance,
which render them so valuable as
irregular warriors? This inquiry,
however, is not worth pursuing; for
we suppose there is little chance of
Uncle Sam meddling in European
quarrels, and sincerely trust he will
so curb his annexing mania as to
avoid all risk of European armaments
encountering him in his own hemisphere.
Touching these Missourian
volunteers, however, Mr Parkman's
account of their appearance, and of
his interview with them, is most
graphic and characteristic. One forenoon
he and his companion, Mr Shaw,
turned aside to the river bank, half-a-mile
from the trail, to get water and
rest. They put up a kind of awning,
and whilst seated under it upon their
buffalo robes, and smoking, they saw
a dark body of horsemen approaching.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"'We are going to catch it now,'
said Shaw: 'look at those fellows;
there'll be no peace for us here.' And,
in good truth, about half the volunteers
had straggled away from the line of
march, and were riding over the meadow
towards us.</p>

<p>"'How are you?' said the first who
came up, alighting from his horse, and
throwing himself upon the ground. The
rest followed close, and a score of them
soon gathered about us, some lying at
full length, and some sitting on horseback.
They all belonged to a company
raised in St Louis. There were some
ruffian faces among them, and some haggard
with debauchery; but, on the whole,
they were extremely good-looking men,
superior beyond measure to the ordinary
rank and file of an army. Except that
they were booted to the knees, they wore
their belts and military trappings over
the ordinary dress of citizens. Besides
their swords and holster pistols, they
carried, slung from their saddles, the
excellent Springfield carbines, loaded at
the breech. They inquired the character
of our party, and were anxious to know
the prospect of killing buffalo, and the
chance that their horses would stand the
journey to Santa Fé. All this was well
enough, but a moment after a worse
visitation came upon us.</p>

<p>"'How are you, strangers? Whar
are you going, and whar are you from?'
said a fellow, who came trotting up with
an old straw hat on his head. He was
dressed in the coarsest brown homespun
cloth. His face was rather sallow, from
fever and ague, and his tall figure, although
strong and sinewy, was quite thin, and
had, besides, an angular look, which,
together with his boorish seat on horseback,
gave him an appearance anything
but graceful. Plenty more of the same
stamp were close behind him. Their
company was raised in one of the frontier
counties, and we soon had abundant
evidence of their rustic breeding: dozens
of them came crowding round, pushing
between our first visitors, and staring at
us with unabashed faces.</p>

<p>"'Are you the captain?' asked one
fellow.</p>

<p>"'What's your business out here?' inquired
another.</p>

<p>"'Whar do you live when you're at
home?' said a third.</p>

<p>"'I reckon you're traders,' surmised a
fourth; and, to crown the whole, one of
them came confidently to my side, and
inquired, in a low voice, 'What is your
partner's name?'</p>

<p>"As each new comer repeated the
same questions, the nuisance became
intolerable. Our military visitors were
soon disgusted at the concise nature of
our replies, and we could overhear them
muttering curses against us. Presently,
to our amazement, we saw a large
cannon with four horses come lumbering
up behind the crowd; and the driver,
who was perched on one of the animals,
stretching his neck so as to look over the
rest of the men, called out,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Whar are you from, and what's
your business?'</p>

<p>"The captain of one of the companies
was amongst our visitors, drawn by the
same curiosity that had attracted his men.</p>

<p>"'Well, men,' said he at last, lazily
rising from the ground where he had
been lounging, 'it's getting late; I
reckon we had better be moving.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"'I shan't start yet, anyhow,' said one
fellow, who lay half asleep, with his head
resting on his arm.</p>

<p>"'Don't be in a hurry, captain,' added
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"'Well, have it your own way, we'll
wait awhile longer,' replied the obsequious
commander.</p>

<p>"At length, however, our visitors went
straggling away as they had come, and
we, to our great relief, were left alone
again."</p></blockquote>

<p>A most mirth-provoking specimen
of American character. But we must
return to our friend and favourite,
Lieutenant Wise, who is truly a
Yankee Crichton in a pea-jacket.
Besides his nautical skill, and the
lingual accomplishments already adverted
to, he is a Nimrod in the hunting-field,
a Centaur on horseback, a
Vestris in the mazes of the dance.
Lovers of wild sports in the West
will luxuriate in his descriptions of
hunting exploits, of his combats with
grizzly bears fourteen hundred pounds
weight, and his chase of an antelope
whose fore-leg he had nearly severed
from its shoulder with a rifle bullet,
but which still managed to run four
leagues, the wounded member "traversing
round in its flight like a
wheel," before receiving its death-wound.
Unable to extract a tithe of
the passages that tempt us, we hurry
on to his departure for the Mexican
capital, whither he was sent early in
the month of May, as bearer of a
despatch, and in company with a
Mexican officer, with whom the lieutenant
was at first disposed to be most
friendly and sociable, but who forfeited
his esteem by the cool proposal
of a plan to cheat the government,
and whom he soon managed to leave
behind&mdash;no difficult matter, for the
Mexican was cumbered with portmanteau
and sumpter mule, whereas
the Yankee's sole baggage, as he himself
informs us, consisted of two shirts
and a toothbrush. Thus lightly
equipped, his pace was very rapid;
not so much so, however, as to prevent
his noting down all that occurred
by the way. After La Barca and
Ruxton, it is a difficult task to give
novelty to an account of Mexican
travel and peculiarities. Mr
Wise has surmounted the difficulty;
and so great is the freshness and
originality of his narrative, that
we read it with as much zest and
enjoyment as if it were the first
instead of the twentieth book relating
to Mexico which we have perused
within the last few years. His anecdotes
are most racy and piquant;
his sketches of Mexican women,
officers, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">leperos</i>, and of his own countrymen
in Mexico, are taken from the
life with a truthful and vivid pencil.
With the class of leperos he had already
made acquaintance on the
threshold of the country. Turning, one
day, into a bowling alley at Mazatlan,
with the officers of a British frigate,
he gave a fine horse to hold to one of
those Mexican mendicants. The fellow's
hatred of the <em>gringos</em> was stronger
than his love of gain; for no sooner
was he left alone than he drew a
pistol from the holsters, shot the
horse, and ran for his life, which certainly
would not have been worth a
maravedi had he tarried for the arrival
of the enraged lieutenant. "Oh, Mr
Smithers!" exclaims the disconsolate
mariner thus cruelly dismounted&mdash;"Oh,
Mr Smithers! you keep a good
ten-pin alley, sing a good song, and
your wife prepares good chocolate;
you are, together, good fellows; but
you should never, O Smithers! transform
your establishment into a knacker's
yard. And you, my cruel <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">lepero</i>!
had I ever got a sight of you along
that weapon you handled so well&mdash;ah!
I wellnigh wept for sorrow that
night, and did not recover my spirits
for a fortnight." The leperos, we
need hardly explain, are the pest of
Mexico&mdash;ragged, dirty, often disgusting
with disease or deformity, born
idlers, beggars, and thieves&mdash;in the
latter capacity so especially skilful,
that Mr Wise inclines to the belief
that a man, standing open-mouthed
in a crowd of them, could hardly escape
having the gold picked from his
molars. They reaped a rich harvest at
the time of the American invasion.
It was a case of "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nos amis les ennemis</i>."
The conquerors were preyed
upon by the conquered. Iron bars
were unavailing against the cunning
rogues. "One evening some expert
practitioner contrived to entice a
valuable pair of pistols, clothing, and
other articles, from my table in the
centre of a large apartment, by introducing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a pole and hook through the
iron <em>grille</em> of the window; and the
same night, my friend Molinero was
robbed of his bed-clothes, while sleeping,
by the same enterprising method."
By a strange tolerance, these leperos
are admitted everywhere; and in the
splendid coffee and gambling houses
of the large cities, they are found rubbing
their filthy rags against officers'
embroideries and the fine broadcloth
of wealthy burgesses. At Guanaxato,
Mr Wise gives a lively description of
a scene of this kind in the handsome
saloons of the <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Gran Sociedad</i>, recalling
to our memory, though at a long
interval, some striking pages of the
first volume of Sealsfield's gorgeous
Mexican romance, <cite>Der Virey and
die Aristocraten</cite>. The lepero's chief
pastimes are thieving, sleeping, and
gambling for copper coins. By way
of variety, he occasionally gets up a
mortal combat. We think the following
the best account of a knife-duel
we ever read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"A lepero was purchasing a bit of
chocolate; it fell in the dirt, when another,
probably thinking it a lawful prize,
seized it and took a large bite; whereupon
the lawful owner swung a mass of heavy
steel spurs attached to his wrist, jingling,
with some force, on the offender's head.
In a second down dropped the spurs, and
<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">serapas</i> (a kind of blanket) were wound
round the left arms. With low deep
curses and flashing eyes, their knives
gleamed in the light; the spectators
cleared a ring, and to work they went.
I sprang upon a stone pillar to be out of
harm's way, and thus had a clear view of
the fray. Their blades were very unequally
matched: one was at least eight
inches, and the other not half that measurement;
but both appeared adepts at
the game, watching each other like wild
cats, ready for a spring&mdash;moving cautiously
to and fro, making feints by the
shielded arm, or stamp of the foot, for a
minute or two; when, quick as a flash, I
saw two rapid passes made by both:
blood spirted from an ugly wound in the
spur-vender's throat, but at the same
moment his short weapon sealed the doom
of his antagonist, and he lay upon the
ground, lifeless as the bloody steel that
struck him. I glanced at the wounds
after the affair had terminated, and found
the knife had been plunged twice directly
in the region of the heart. There was no
effort or attempt made by the beholders
to arrest the parties; and the survivor
caught up his spurs&mdash;a bystander quickly
folded a handsome kerchief to his neck&mdash;and
threading the crowd he was soon out
of sight. The corpse was laid upon a
liquor-stand, with a delf platter upon the
breast."</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mexican capital was not a little
Americanised at the period of Mr
Wise's visit. The account he gives
of the state of affairs there, is not very
creditable to the morals and tastes of
the victorious volunteers; and he expresses
a natural doubt whether the
scenes there enacted will have been
beneficial to the thousands of young
men whom the war had called to
Mexico. The great hotels and coffee-houses
were all under Yankee dominion,
with Yankee ice, and drinks,
signs, manners, customs, and habits,
"as if the city had been from time
immemorial Yankeefied all over, instead
of being only occupied a short
twelvemonth by the troops." Debauchery
of every kind was rife, but
gambling was the vice that took the
strongest hold. In the large tavern
or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">restauration</i>, where Mr Wise usually
dined, in every nook from hall to attic,
with the exception of the eating-room,
in the corridors and on the landing-places,
gaming-tables were displayed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Such a condensed essence of worldly
hell, in all its glaring, disgusting frightfulness,
never existed. And there never
was lack of players either&mdash;no! not a
table but was closely surrounded by officers
and soldiers&mdash;blacklegs and villains
of all sorts&mdash;betting uncommonly high,
too&mdash;many of the banks having sixty and
eighty thousand dollars in gold alone on
the tables&mdash;and once I saw a common
soldier stake and win two hundred ounces
at a single bet. Other saloons were filled
with Mexican girls, with music and dancing,
attended by every species of vice, all
going on unceasingly, day and night together."</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an American's account. Of
course most of this lavish expenditure
and gambled gold had their origin in
the plunder of Mexico. Indeed, Lieutenant
Wise does not mince the matter
at all, but informs us how he himself,
after a night-excursion in the vicinity
of Mazatlan, returned laden with
spoil, and felt such an itching to
search people's pockets that he made
no doubt of soon becoming as good a
freebooter as ever drew sword. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
was then, however, but a novice in
the science of pillage, for he afterwards
learned that a saddle, which he had
appropriated, contained six golden
ounces, whereby the saddler, to whom
he intrusted it for renovation, was
much benefited. When an officer
holding the United States commission
saw nothing derogatory in plunder,
there can be no doubt of the
rapacity of the dissipated and reckless
desperadoes of which the American
expeditionary force was notoriously
in part composed. And in an
army where discipline was lax, and
a spirit of anti-military equality prevailed
amongst officers and men, the
contagion would rapidly spread.
Doubtless this was an aggravating
cause of Mexican hatred to the
<em>Gringos</em>. Nevertheless, when the
fighting was over, kindness and attention
were shown to the invaders, and
some of the Mexican officers appear
to have been thrashed into a most
affectionate regard for their conquerors.
One fine fellow, a colonel of cavalry,
all gold and glitter, with richly chased
sabre scabbard, and spurs of a dazzling
burnish, insisted upon giving a
breakfast to a large party of American
officers. There were a number of
Mexican <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">militaires</i> present, all decorated,
some with emblems of battles
in which they had been defeated; and
as the repast was in some degree
public, (being held in a large billiard-room,)
a number of casual observers
assembled round the table, and helped
to drink the numerous toasts, pocketing
their glasses after each, to be
ready for the next. The banquet
began with a bumper of brandy, by
way of whet; a most miscellaneous
collection of edibles was then placed
upon the board, and claret and sherry
circulated rapidly to the health and
memory of a host of living and dead
generals, both Mexican and American,
beginning with Washington and
Hidalgo, and gradually arriving at
Santa Anna and "Skote," (Scott,) for
which last-named pair of warriors
Mr Wise estimates that at least eighty
or ninety cheers were given. The
Mexicans, habitually temperate, got
exceedingly drunk, and, like most
southerns when in that state, furiously
excited; the chief characteristics
of their intoxication being unbounded
affection for their guests,
and admiration of their own prowess.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Our gallant host, in a few disjointed
observations, assured us that he was not
only brave himself, and loved bravery in
others, but that his horse was brave, and
had been wounded in divers battles. '<i lang="es" xml:lang="es">Io
soy valiente!</i>' said the fierce colonel,
pounding the orders on his capacious
breast, and forthwith proclaimed to the
audience his intention to pay for everything
that anybody could possibly eat or
drink for a fortnight; and, seizing me by
the arms, he impressively remarked that
I was the most intimate friend he ever
had except his wife, and requested me to
throw his huge shako up to the ceiling,
solely for <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">amistad</i>, and for the good-fellowship
of the thing&mdash;which I instantly
did, and made the bearskin and golden
plates ring against the rafters. Thereupon
he called for more wine, and desired
all who loved him to break a few glasses,
commencing himself with a couple of
decanters."</p></blockquote>

<p>At which period of the action the
landlord cut off the supplies of liquor,
anticipating, doubtless, the entire
demolition of his establishment; and
the revellers got to horse, and went
for a turn in the Alameda, then
thronged by all the fashion of Queretaro,
in which city these jovial proceedings
occurred. After galloping
round the promenade, at a pace that
terrified the natives, Lieutenant Wise
ran a "jouist," as he calls it, with
one of his Mexican friends, who was
still under the influence of his unwonted
libations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In true Californian style, he shook
his bridle, gave spur, and came leaping
like a flash towards me. I was no novice
at the sport, and, touching one of the
finest horses in the army with my heel,
the gallant sorrel sprang forward to
meet him. We met in full career; my
charger stood like the great pyramid, but
the shock rolled my antagonist into the
street. I should in courtesy have got
down from the saddle to his assistance,
but, reflecting that without a ladder I
never should be able to get on my high
steed again, I remained quiet. Being a
sailor, I gained great reputation by this
feat, and gave an entertainment on the
strength of it."</p></blockquote>

<p>Surely there never was a jollier
fellow than Lieutenant Wise of the
United States navy. A rare good
companion he must be, a real <em>bonus</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socius</i> across a julep, a very storehouse
of fun, frolic, and adventure. So well
do we like his society, that we are
only sorry we cannot at present accompany
him further on his rambles,
or return with him to Mazatlan, where
he arrived at a flying gallop, after a
ride of 2500 miles on horseback&mdash;the
last 112 leagues in fifty-three hours,
(said to be the quickest trip on record,)
to be received by a host of friends,
and by a Yankee band playing, "Hail,
Columbia!" and sail with him to
Polynesia, and revisit Valparaiso and
Lima, and many other places, in all
of which he manages heartily to amuse
both himself and his reader, till he
finally drops anchor in the waters of
the Chesapeake, arriving, with equal
satisfaction to both parties, at the end
of 450 pages, and 55,000 miles. His
book richly deserves an independent
notice; but as we started by associating
it with others, we are compelled
to lay it aside, whilst we visit the
glittering coast of California, in company
with Mr Theodore Johnson, who
arrived on the 1st of April 1849 in
Sancelito Bay, and proceeded forthwith
to look for the city of the same
name, whose wide and elegant streets
he had frequently traced upon the
map. After some search, he found
the city. "It consisted of one board-shed
and one tent, holding on to the
hill-side like a woodpecker against a
tree." Thus was his first illusion dissipated.
A few other Californian
castles were speedily to crumble. "The
latitude of Richmond, and climate of
Italy, the gold of Ophir, the silver,
red wood and cedar of Solomon's
temple, the lovely valley of the Sacramento,
the vineyards of France, indigo
of Hindostan, and wheat of America,
golden rocks, and rivers flowing over
the same metal," such were a few of
the bright promises that had lured
him, "in company with thousands of
his go-ahead countrymen," to the Eldorado
of the Pacific. These were the
things he expected; let us collect,
from his first week's experience in
California, those that he really found.
Ugly barren hills, a miserable sandy-clay
soil, producing a weed which a
starving jackass will scorn, and a fine
dust, against which the most impenetrable
eyelids are not proof, a repulsive
and disagreeable climate in the
month of April, (growing worse as the
summer advances,) the extremes of
heat and cold following each other in
constant succession, water often extremely
scarce, and impregnated with
quicksilver, platina, and other minerals,
killing the fish, and giving Christians
the Sacramento fever, "a slow,
continual fever, which men go about
with for months; but in its more violent
forms soon mortal, always affecting
the brain, and, in case of recovery,
leaving the mind impaired. The lung
fever and rheumatism are brought on
by working in the cold water, and
stooping continually under the burning
sun." The scurvy, too, was prevalent,
from the use of salt provisions,
for none could find time to procure
fresh ones, to hunt or tend cattle; and
if they did leave their eternal digging
for such pursuits, the prices they expected
were preposterous. Wild cattle
and game are plenty in the valley of the
Sacramento and adjacent mountains,
but in California the hours are truly
golden, and not to be wasted on kitchen
considerations; to say nothing of the
hardship of driving wild oxen or carrying
a gun across a rugged country with
the thermometer at 109° to 112° in
the shade&mdash;the usual temperature in
June and July, and one fully justifying
the derivation of the name California
from two Spanish words signifying
a hot oven, <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">caliente horno</i>.
"The thermometer stood at 90° Fahrenheit,
at noon, in the shade of
Culloma valley, on the 16th of April;
and at night we slept cold in our tent
with our clothing on, and provided
with abundant blankets." With such
a climate, and with no grass in the
mountains fit to sustain them, it is no
wonder that the best pack-horses can
carry but one hundred and fifty to
two hundred pounds weight across the
mountains, and frequently fall down
and die if overladen. At the time
referred to&mdash;that is to say, in the month
of April last&mdash;Mr Johnson "continually
saw old miners departing for the
cañons<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of the middle and north
Forks, with one month's supply of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
provisions, consisting of seventy-five
lb. of pork and seventy-five lb. of
pilot bread, for which they paid respectively
at the rates of one hundred
and fifty and one hundred and twenty
dollars per hundred pounds! Now,
although the prices of these articles
were rapidly declining on the sea-board,
by reason of the immense importation,
yet the price of fresh beef was twenty-five
dollars per hundred pounds in
San Francisco, and must farther enhance
there, the supply then being
quite insufficient. Fresh provisions
will therefore be consumed at the seaport
and trading towns, and not in
the mining region. The humbug of
preserved meats was already exploded,
great quantities having been spoiled."
All this was very different from the
promised vineyards and corn-fields;
and Mr Johnson, who had not come
to California to feed on salt junk at six
shillings a pound, and to drink mercurial
water, began to wish himself back
again almost as soon as arrived.</p>

<p>In countries where a large majority
of the men are content to give,
year after year, their skill, energy,
and time, in exchange for a few hundred
pieces of gold, or even of silver,
the reports of a land where the most
precious of these metals turns up under
the ploughshare, abounds in the
rivers, mingles with the highway-dust,
and is picked from the bricks of
the houses, are naturally at first
received with doubt and misgiving,
and suspected of exaggeration, if not
condemned as fiction. We confess,
for our part, that we attached little
weight to the first accounts of Californian
marvels, and that long after
the wise men of the East had begun
to debate, in the shadow of the grasshopper,
the possible effect upon the
currency of the anticipated influx of
the produce of the diggings, we still
were sceptics as to the magnitude of
the newly-found treasure. But even
those who gave readiest credence to
the tale of wonder, could hardly, we
should have thought, have expected
that the ingots were to be gathered
without trouble or pain beyond that
of performing a long journey and
filling a big bag. Evidently this
was Mr Johnson's notion, and that of
not a few others of his sanguine countrymen,
"who left their homes and
families, and the decencies of civilisation,
with the expectation of acquiring
an adequate competency by the efforts
of a single year." At what figure
Mr Johnson rates an "adequate competency"
we know not; but it is evident
he expected to be placed on
pretty nearly the same footing as
those Oriental princes who, after wandering
through the desert to the enchanted
gardens, had the free pick of
trees whose fruits were diamonds and
rubies. The real state of affairs
proved very different. A few persons,
dwellers in California when the
golden richness of the soil was first
discovered in 1848,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> may have made
large fortunes on easy terms, by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
early in the field, and through barter
with the Indians, who (before they
were frightened and soured by the
shooting and scalping practices of the
Oregonians and others) were willing
enough to labour and trade, and to
give gold-dust weight for weight for
glass beads and other baubles. We
read of one man, a western farmer,
owner and occupier of a loghouse,
known as the Blue Tent, who
arrived in California before the
gold discoveries, treated the Indians
well, learned their language, employed
them to dig, and realised, it
is said, two hundred thousand dollars.
Another old settler, we are
told, accumulated, in the season of
1848, also by help of the Indians,
nearly two bushels of gold-dust. Our
arithmetic is not equal to the reduction
of this into pounds sterling, but
at a rough estimate we should take it
to represent a very pleasing sum&mdash;possibly
the competency Mr Johnson
aspired to. But those palmy days of
gold-gathering have fled, violently
driven away; the Indians, welcomed
with bullets instead of beads, will
work no more, and every man must dig
for himself. And so did Mr Johnson&mdash;but
only for a very short time, and
with no very prosperous result. The
gold fever, under whose influence he
and his companions started for the
diggings, was still burning in their
veins when, on the second day after
leaving San Francisco, they halted for
the night on the river bank, and one
of them, "thrusting his bowie-knife
into the ground, revealed innumerable
shining yellow particles, immediately
announced gold discoveries on the
Sacramento, and claimed the <em>placer</em>."
But it was mica, not gold. They had
much further to go, and worse to fare,
before reaching the right metal. It
was the interest of the United States'
government and of certain speculators
to tempt emigrants to the distant territory
on the shore of the Pacific; and
accordingly, says Mr Johnson, "the
wonders of the gold region were trumpeted
to the world, with unabating,
but by no means unforeseeing zeal.
Glowing accounts were sent to the
United States of the result of all the
most successful efforts in the mines.
To these were added a delicious climate
and wonderful agricultural fertility.
The inaccessibility of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">placeres</i>,
the diseases, the hardships, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
were quite forgotten or omitted." And
thus a certain number of ambitious
young men, (many of them wholly unfitted,
by their previous mode of life
for roughing it in a new country,)
were lured from their comfortable
homes in New York and elsewhere, in
the confident expectation that, on arriving
in California, they would ascend
beauteous rivers in commodious ships,
sleep on board at night, and pleasantly
pass a few hours of each day in collecting
the wealth that lay strewn
upon the shore. Such is the account
given of the matter by poor Johnson,
who denounces the journey across the
mountainous and roadless country as
most toilsome, and the whole adventure
as disappointing and unsatisfactory.
At last he and his companions
reached the lower bar<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> on the south
fork of American River, shouldered
shovels, buckets, and washing-machine,
and applied themselves to the
task.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The scene presented to us was new
indeed, and not more extraordinary than
impressive. Some, with long-handled
shovels, delved among clumps of bushes,
or by the side of large rocks, never raising
their eyes for an instant; others, with
pick and shovel, worked among stone and
gravel, or with trowels searched under
banks and roots of trees, where, if rewarded
with small lumps of gold, the eye
shone brighter for an instant, when the
search was immediately and more ardently
resumed. At the edge of the stream, or
knee-deep and waist-deep in water, as
cold as melted ice and snow could make
it, some were washing gold with tin pans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
or the common cradle-rocker, while the
rays of the sun poured down on their
heads with an intensity exceeding any
thing we ever experienced at home,
though it was but the middle of April.
The thirst for gold and the labour of
acquisition overruled all else, and totally
absorbed every faculty. Complete silence
reigned among the miners: they addressed
not a word to each other, and seemed
averse to all conversation."</p></blockquote>

<p>After digging and washing twenty
bucketfuls of earth, Mr Johnson's
party had obtained but four dollars'
worth of gold. At noon, the sun's
heat being intolerable, they knocked
off from work; not much encouraged
by the result. This, however, they
admit, was a poor digging, the stream
being yet too high, and the bar not
sufficiently exposed&mdash;to say nothing
of their being novices at the work.
They persisted little, however: another
trial was made with no better result;
and, in short, a week's effort and observation
sickened them of a toil so far
less lucrative than they had anticipated.
Two of the party (Mr Johnson
was one of them) resolved to
return to San Francisco till the healthier
season of winter; a third, having
some goods, took to trading; the
fourth and last, a hardy little down-easter
from Maine, stuck to the diggings.</p>

<p>By this time, we are not entirely
dependent on American books or newspaper
correspondence for intelligence
from the Californian mines. Some
portion of the gold that has come to
this country has been brought by the
finders; and only the other day, a
party of them reached England, having
left the diggings as lately as the
beginning of October. The details
obtained from these men, who are of
various European countries, confirm,
in all important particulars, the statements
of Mr Johnson, with merely the
difference of tint imparted by failure
and success. Either easily discouraged
or physically unequal to encounter
the hardships inseparable
from the search for and extraction of
the gold, Mr Johnson, disappointed in
his sanguine expectations, makes a
sombre report of the speculation;
whereas these more persevering and
prosperous miners, having safely returned
to Europe, their pockets full of
"chunks," scales and dust of the most
undeniable purity and excellence, naturally
give a more rose-coloured view
of the enterprise. They admit, however,
(to use the words of one of
them,) that "it takes a smart lad to
do good in California," and that it is
useless for any one to go thither unless
prepared to rough it, in the fullest
sense of the word. At first, they inform
us the amount of theft and outrage
was very great; but summary
and severe punishment checked this.
Mr Johnson deplores the existence of
Lynch-law. It really appears to us
that California is the very place where
such a system is not only justifiable,
but indispensable. One miner stated
that he belonged to a band or club,
thirty in number, who threw together
all the gold they found, and shared
alike; sharp penalties being denounced
against any member of the society
who attempted to divert his findings
from the common stock. The amount
obtained by each member of this joint-stock
company during the season
of eight or nine months was equivalent
to thirteen or fourteen hundred
pounds sterling. Not quite the "adequate
competency" anticipated by
Mr Theodore T. Johnson, but still a
very pretty gain for men, most of
whom would probably have found it
impossible, in any other way, and in
the same time, to earn a tithe of the
amount. More than one of them
proposed, after depositing his treasure
safely in Europe, to augment it
by a second trip to the gold region;
and held the time occupied by the
voyage to and fro as little loss, digging
being impeded by the winter snows.
The winter of 1848-9 was very severe,
the snow lying four feet deep on the
mountains, and having fallen even on
the coast; a circumstance unprecedented
in California, whose Spanish
and Indian inhabitants attributed
the disagreeable phenomenon to the
American intruders. Notwithstanding
this unwonted rigour, however, we
learn from Mr Johnson that "large
numbers of hardy and industrious
Oregonians spent the last <em>winter</em> in
the mines of California, generally with
success commensurate with their perseverance,
prudence, and sobriety."
The lumps of gold, according to the
account of the miners already referred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
to, (and which tallies exactly in this
particular with Mr Johnson's statement)
are found in what are called
the dry diggings, in the red sandy
clay of the ravines on the mountain
sides; whilst the dust and scales are
obtained by washing the earth and
sand from the rivers. Lumps of pure
gold, with a greater or less admixture
of quartz, are also found in the crevices
of a white-veined rock.</p>

<p>Whilst denouncing the expense of
health and labour at which the
Californian gold is obtained, Mr
Johnson admits the vast quantity of
the metal that has been and still is
being collected. In town, fort, and
settlement,&mdash;in every place, in short,
where a score or two of men were
congregated, he beheld astonishing
evidence of its abundance. "Quarts
of the dust or scale gold were to be
seen on the tables or counters, or in
the safes of all classes of men; and
although the form of small scales was
most common, yet pieces or lumps of
a quarter to three ounces were to be
seen everywhere; and among several
<em>chunks</em> one was shown us by C. L.
Ross, Esq., weighing <em>eighty-one ounces</em>.
This was solid pure gold with only
the appearance of a little quartz in it."
In one day he saw bushels of gold,
most of it too pure for jewellery or coin,
without alloy. Although the price of
the metal was maintained at sixteen
dollars per ounce, its depreciation in
comparison with labour and merchandise
was enormous; and in the mines,
during the winter of 1848, "a good
deal of gold was sold for <em>three or four
dollars the ounce</em>." Carpenters and
blacksmiths received an ounce a-day.
Lumber was at six hundred dollars per
thousand feet. A lot of land, purchased
two years previously for a cask of
brandy, fetched eighteen thousand dollars.
At a French <em>café</em>, a cup of coffee,
bit of ham, and two eggs, cost three
dollars, or 12s. 6d. A host of details
of this kind are added, most of which
have already been given in the American
and English newspapers. Captain
Sutter's saw-mill was earning a thousand
dollars a-day. At the Stanislaus
diggings, in the winter of 1848-9, a box
of raisins, greatly needed for the cure
of scurvy, then raging there without
remedy, sold for its weight in gold dust,
or four thousand dollars! Reckless
expenditure is the natural consequence
of easily-acquired wealth. The diggers,
after a brief period of severe
labour, would come into town for
what they called "a burst," and
scatter their gold dust and ingots like
sand and pebbles, keeping "upon the
ball" for three or four days and nights,
or even for a week together, drinking
brandy at eight and champagne at
sixteen dollars the bottle, often getting
helplessly drunk and losing the whole
of their gains. One fellow, during a
three days' drunken fit, got rid
of sixteen thousand dollars in gold.
Two hopeful youths, known as Bill and
Gus, who took an especial liking to Mr
Johnson and his party, had come in
for "a particular, general, and universal
burst;" and they carried out
their intentions most completely.
They were tender in their liquor, and,
in the excess of their drunken philanthropy,
they purchased a barrel of
ale at three dollars a bottle, and a
parcel of sardinas at eight dollars a
box, and patrolled the district, forcing
every one to drink. In paying for
something, Bill dropped a lump of
gold, worth two or three dollars,
which Mr Johnson picked up, and
handed to him. "Without taking it,
he looked at us with a comical mixture
of amazement and ill-humour,
and at length broke out with&mdash;'Well,
stranger, you <em>are</em> a curiosity; I guess
you hain't been in the diggins long,
and better keep that for a sample.'"
Even in all sobriety, miners would
not be troubled with anything less
than dollars, and often scattered
small coins by handfuls in the streets,
rather than count or carry them.
And as neither exorbitant prices nor
drunken bursts sufficed to exhaust the
resources of the gold-laden diggers,
gambling went on upon all sides.
"Talk of <em>placers</em>," cried an American,
who had just cleared his thousand
dollars in ten minutes, at a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">monte</i>-table in San Francisco; "what
better <em>placer</em> need a man want than
this?" At Sutter's Fort, a halting-place
of the miners, gambling prevailed
without limit or stint, men
often losing in a single night the result
of many months' severe toil. Drunkenness
and fighting diversified the
scene. "Hundreds of dollars were
often spent in a night, and thousands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
on Sunday, <em>when Pandemonium was
in full blast</em>." Such iniquities were
no more than might be expected
amongst the ragamuffin crew assembled
in California, and which included
discharged convicts from New South
Wales, Mexicans, Kanakas, Peruvians,
Chilians, representatives of
every European nation, and thousands
of the more dissolute and reckless class
of United States men.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that some
of the minority of honest and respectable
men, who found themselves
mingled with the mob of ruffians
and outlaws assembled in California,
thought the prospect of wealth
dearly purchased by a prolonged residence
in vile society and a most trying
climate, and by labour and exposure
destructive to health. Mr Johnson
assures us that, among the miners
who had been long at the diggings,
he saw very few who were not
suffering from disease&mdash;emaciated by
fever till they were mere walking shadows,
or tormented by frequently recurring attacks
of scurvy and rheumatism.
If there was a constant stream of adventurers
proceeding to the diggings,
there was also a pretty steady flow of
weary and sickly men returning thence.
It would seem, from Mr Johnson's
account, that no previous habit of
hard labour qualifies the human
frame to follow, without injury, the
trying trade of a gold-grubber. "We
met a party of six sailors, of the Pacific
whalers, who were returning to
go before the mast again, swearing,
sailor-fashion, that they would rather
go a whaling at half wages than dig
gold any more." Mr Johnson was
somewhat of the same way of thinking.
He sums up a general review
of California in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"So large an emigration of the American
people, as have gone to that territory,
must make something of the country.
They will make it one of the states of
this Union, at all events, and speedily,
too: and although the country is only
adapted by nature for mining and grazing,
yet a constant trade must result from the
former, and more or less agriculture be
added to the latter, from the necessity of
the case. A few have made, and will
hereafter make fortunes there, and very
many of those who remain long enough
will accumulate something; but the great
mass, all of whom expected to acquire
large amounts of gold in a short time,
must be comparatively disappointed. The
writer visited California to dig gold, but
chose to abandon that purpose rather than
expose his life and health in the mines;
and as numbers were already seeking
employment in San Francisco without
success, and he had neither the means nor
the inclination to speculate, he concluded
to return to his family and home industry."</p></blockquote>

<p>Finally, the disappointed gold-seeker
addresses to his readers a
parting hint, apprehensive, seemingly,
of their supposing that his own ill-success
has warped his judgment, or
induced him to calumniate the country.
"If you think," he says, "we have
not shown you enough of <em>the elephant</em>,
but got on the wrong way and slid off
backwards, please to mount him and
take a view for yourself." By which
metaphorical phrase, if the worthy
Johnson means that we are to go to
the diggings, and judge for ourselves,
we can only say we had much rather
take his word than his advice, and
read his book by our fireside than
tread in his footsteps amongst the
mountains of California.</p>

<p>Without further comment, but with
a warm recommendation, we close
these three American volumes. It
were idle to subject to minute criticism
books that make no pretensions
to literary merit, and which, professing
only to give, in plain language, an
account of the writers' personal adventures
and experiences, are written
in off-hand style, and are wholly free
from pedantry and affectation. If
they are occasionally somewhat rude
in form, like the men and countries
they portray, they at least are frank
and honest in substance; and they
contain more novelty, amusement,
and information, than are to be found
in any dozen of those vapid narratives
of fashionable tourists with which the
Bentley and Colburn presses annually
cram the nauseated public. We have
been much pleased and diverted by
the unsophisticated pages of Messrs
Johnson, Wise, and Parkman.</p>

<h2>HOWARD.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></h2>


<p>To add another to the numerous
eulogies which have been justly bestowed
on the memory of Howard the
philanthropist, is not our object. We
are far from making the attempt: our
aim is to contribute something to the
more accurate and familiar knowledge
of the man himself&mdash;his life, his character,
his career, his services.</p>

<p>It not unfrequently happens that the
great men of history, whom we have
admired in our youth, sink grievously
in our estimation, and lose their heroic
port and proportions, when we survey
them more nearly, and at a season
of maturer judgment. They
shrink into the bounds and limits of
commonplace mortality. We venture
even to administer reproof and castigation,
where, perhaps, we had venerated
almost to idolatry. Such is not
the case with Howard. Poets have
sung his praises, and his name has
rounded many an eloquent period.
Howard the philanthropist becomes
very soon a name as familiar to us as
those of the kings and queens who
have sat upon our throne; but the
vague admiration, thus early instilled
into us, suffers no diminution when,
at an after period, we become intimately
acquainted with the character
of the man. We may approach the
idol here without danger to our faith.
We may analyse the motive&mdash;we
may "vex, probe, and criticise"&mdash;it
is all sound. Take your stethoscope
and listen&mdash;there is no hollow here&mdash;every
pulse beats true.</p>

<p>The Howard that poets and orators
had taught us to admire loses none
of its greatness on a near approach.
But it undergoes a remarkable <em>transformation</em>.
The real Howard, who
devoted his life to the jail and the
lazaretto, was a very different person
from that ideal of benevolence which
the verse of Darwin, or the eloquence
of Burke, had called up into our minds.
Instead of this faint and classic ideal,
we have the intensely and somewhat
sternly religious man, guided and sustained,
every step of his way, not
alone, nor principally, by the amiable
but vacillating sentiment which passes
under the name of philanthropy, but
by an exalted, severe, imperative
sense of duty. It is Howard the
Christian, Howard the Puritan, that
stands revealed before us. The form
changes, but only to grow more distinct
and intelligible. The features
have no longer that classic outline we
had attributed to them; but they
bear henceforth the stamp of reality&mdash;of
a man who, without doubt, had
lived and moved amongst us.</p>

<p>Those who have rested content
(and we think there are many such)
with that impression of Howard which
is derived from the panegyrics scattered
through our polite literature,
and who accordingly attribute to him,
as the master-motive of his conduct,
simply a wide benevolence&mdash;a sentiment
of humanity exalted to a passion&mdash;must
be conscious of a certain
uneasy sense of doubt, an involuntary
scepticism; must feel that there is
something here unexplained, or singularly
exaggerated. Their Howard,
if they should scrutinise their impression,
is a quite anomalous person.
No philanthropist they have ever
heard of&mdash;no mere lover of his kind,
sustained only by the bland sentiment
of humanity, not even supported by
any new enthusiastic faith in the perfectibility
of the species&mdash;ever lived
the life of this man, or passed through
a tithe of his voluntary toils and sufferings.
Philanthropists are generally
distinguished for their love of
speculation; they prefer to think
rather than to act; and their labours
are chiefly bestowed on the composition
of their books. Philanthropists
have occasionally ruined themselves;
but their rash schemes are more notorious
for leading to the ruin of others.
As a race, they are not distinguished
for self-sacrifice, or for practical and
strenuous effort. There must, therefore,
to the persons we are describing,
be a certain doubt and obscurity
hanging over the name of Howard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the philanthropist. It must sound
like a myth or fable; they must half
suspect that, if some Niebuhr should
look into the matter, their heroic
figure would vanish into thin air.</p>

<p>Let them, however, proceed to the
study of the veritable Howard, and
all the mystery clears up. The philanthropist
of the orator gives place
to one who, in the essential elements
of his character, may be ranked with
Christian missionaries and Christian
martyrs. Instead of the half-pagan
ideal, or personification of benevolence,
there rises before them a character
which a rigorous analysis might
justly class with those of St Francis
or Loyola, or whatever the Christian
church has at any time exhibited of
exalted piety and complete self-devotion.
The same spirit which, in past
times, has driven men into the desert,
or shut them up in cells with the
scourge and the crucifix; the same
spirit which has impelled them to
brave all the dangers of noxious climates
and of savage passions, to extend
the knowledge of religion amongst
barbarous nations&mdash;was animating
Howard when he journeyed incessantly
from prison to prison, tracking
human misery into all its hidden and
most loathsome recesses. He who, in
another century, would have been the
founder of a new order of barefooted
monks, became, in Protestant England,
the great exemplar of philanthropic
heroism. Perhaps he too, in
one sense, may be said to have founded
a new religious order, though it is
not bound together by common rules,
and each member of it follows, as he
best may, the career of charitable enterprise
that lies open before him.
The mystery, we say, clears up. Benevolent
our Howard was, undoubtedly,
by nature, as by nature also he
was somewhat imperious; but that
which converted his benevolence into
a ceaseless motive of strenuous action,
of toil, and of sacrifice; that
which <em>utilised</em> his natural love of authority,
transforming it into that requisite
firmness and predominance
over others without which no man, at
least no reformer, can be rigidly just,
and, face to face, admonish, threaten,
and reprove; that which constituted
the mainspring and vital force of his
character, was intense piety, and the
all-prevailing sense of duty to his God.
The craving of his soul was some great
task-work, to be done in the eye of
Heaven. Not the love of man, nor
the praise of man, but conscience, and
to be a servant of the Most High,
were his constant motive and desire.</p>

<p>Men of ardent piety generally apply
themselves immediately to the reproduction
in others of that piety which
they feel to be of such incomparable
importance. This becomes the predominant,
often the sole object of
their lives. It is natural it should be
so. In such minds all the concerns of
the present world sink into insignificance;
and their fellow-men are
nothing, except as they are, or are
not, fellow-Christians. Howard was
an exception to this rule. Owing to
certain circumstances in his own life;
to the manner of his education; to
his deficiency in some intellectual
qualifications, and his pre-eminence in
others, he was led to take the domain
of physical suffering&mdash;of earthly
wretchedness&mdash;for the province in
which to exert his zeal. For the
preacher, or the writer, he was not
formed, either by education or by
natural endowment; but he was a
man of shrewd observation, of great
administrative talent, of untiring perseverance,
and of an insatiable energy.
The St Francis of Protestant England
did not, therefore, go forth as a missionary;
nor did he become the founder
of a new sect, distinguished by any
doctrinal peculiarity; but he girded
himself up to visit, round the world,
the cell of the prisoner&mdash;to examine
the food he ate, the air he breathed,
to rid him of the jail-fever, to drive
famine out of its secret haunts, and
from its neglected prey. It was this
peculiarity which led men to segregate
Howard from the class to which,
by the great elements of his character,
he belongs. To relieve the common
wants of our humanity was his object&mdash;to
war against hunger and disease,
and unjust cruelties inflicted by man
on man, was his chosen task-work;
therefore was it vaguely supposed that
the sentiment of humanity was his
great predominant motive, and that he
was driven about the world by compassion
and benevolence.</p>

<p>His remains lie buried in Russia.
Dr Clarke, in his travels through that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
country, relates that "Count Vincent
Potoçki, a Polish nobleman of the
highest taste and talents, whose magnificent
library and museum would do
honour to any country, through a
mistaken design of testifying his respect
for the memory of Howard, has
signified his intention of taking up the
body that it might be conveyed to his
country seat, where a sumptuous
monument has been prepared for its
reception, upon a small island in the
midst of a lake. His countess, being
a romantic lady, wishes to have an
annual <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fête</i> consecrated to benevolence;
at this the nymphs of the
country are to attend, and strew the
place with flowers." There are many,
we suspect, of his own countrymen and
countrywomen, who would be disposed
to honour the memory of Howard in
a similar manner. They would hang,
or carve, their wreaths of flowers upon
a tomb where the emblems of Christian
martyrdom would be more appropriate.
We need hardly add that the design
of the romantic countess was not put
into execution.</p>

<p>The vague impression prevalent of
this remarkable man has been perpetuated
by another circumstance.
Howard has been unfortunate in his
biographers. Dr Aikin, the earliest
of these, writes like a gentleman and
a scholar; manifests throughout much
good sense, a keen intelligence, and a
high moral feeling; but his account is
brief, and is both defective and deceptive
from his incapacity, or unwillingness,
to portray the religious aspect
of the character he had undertaken to
develop. Dr Aikin's little book may
still be read with advantage for the
general remarks it contains, but it is
no biography. Neither was Dr Aikin
calculated for a biographer. He
wanted both the highest and the lowest
qualifications. Details, such as of
dates and places, he had not the
patience to examine; and he wanted
that rarer quality of mind by which
the writer is enabled to throw himself
into the character of a quite different
man from himself, and almost feel by
force of sympathy the motives which
have actuated him. This the cultivated,
tasteful, but, in spite of his verse,
the quite didactic mind of Aikin, was
incapable of doing.</p>

<p>The Rev. Samuel Palmer, who had
known Howard for thirty years,
appended to a sermon, preached on
the occasion of his death, some account
of his life and career. But this,
as well as several anonymous contributions
to magazines, and a brief
anonymous life which appeared at the
same time, can be considered only in
the light of materials for the future
biographer.</p>

<p>The task lay still open, and Mr
Baldwin Brown, barrister-at-law, undertook
to accomplish it. He appears
to have had all the advantages a
biographer could desire. He had
conversed with the contemporaries
and friends of Howard, and with his
surviving domestics&mdash;an advantage
which no subsequent writer could
hope to profit by; he was put in possession
of the materials which the
Rev. Mr Smith and his family, intimate
friends of Howard, had collected
for the very purpose of such a work
as he was engaged on; Dr Brown,
professor of theology at Aberdeen,
another intimate friend of Howard,
transcribed for him, from his commonplace
book, the memoranda of conversations
held with Howard, and committed
to writing at the time; and,
above all, he was furnished with extracts
and memoranda from diaries
kept by Howard himself, and which
fortunately had escaped the general
conflagration to which the philanthropist,
anticipating and disliking
the curiosity of the biographer, had
devoted his papers. Several influential
men amongst the Dissenters interested
themselves in obtaining information
for him; and the list of those
to whom he expresses obligations of
this kind, occupies two or three pages
of his preface. Mr Brown was himself
a man of religious zeal&mdash;we presume,
from his work, a Dissenter: he
could not fail to appreciate the religious
aspect of Howard's character. As
a lawyer, he was prepared to take an
interest in the subject of his labours&mdash;the
reformation of our prisons and our
penal laws. Thus he brought to his
task many peculiar advantages; and
the work he produced was laborious,
conscientious, and very valuable.
Unfortunately, Mr Baldwin Brown
was a dull writer, by which we here
imply that he was also a dull thinker,
and his book will be pronounced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the generality of readers to be as dull
as it is useful. Notwithstanding the
attractive title it bears, and the many
interesting particulars contained in it,
his biography never attained any
popularity. It was probably read
extensively amongst the Dissenters,
to whose sympathies it more directly
appeals than to those of any other class
of readers; but we think we are right
in saying that it never had much
circulation in the world at large.</p>

<p>More parsonic than the parsons,
our lawyer-divine can resist no opportunity
for sermonising. The eloquence
of a Dissenting pulpit, and that when
it is but indifferently <em>supplied</em>&mdash;the
tedious repetition, and the monotonous
unmodulated periods of his legal
text-books&mdash;these combine, or alternate,
through the pages of Mr Brown.
Yet those who persevere in the perusal
of his book will be rewarded.
He is judicious in the selection of his
materials. He presents us with the
means of forming an accurate conception
of Howard; though, in so doing,
he seems to reveal to an attentive
reader more than he had well understood
himself.</p>

<p>Tedious or not, this is still the only
biography of Howard. A Mr Thomas
Taylor has written what appears to
be an abridgment of the work. His
book is more brief, but it is still more
insipid. What notion Mr T. Taylor
has of biography may be judged of
from this, that he thinks it necessary,
in quoting Howard's own original
letters, to amend and improve the
<em>style</em>&mdash;preserving, as he says, the sense,
but correcting the composition. He
is apparently shocked at the idea that
the philanthropist should express himself
in indifferent English, even though
in a hasty letter to a friend.</p>

<p>Very lately Mr Hepworth Dixon,
whose work has recalled us to this
subject, has presented us with a life
of Howard. It cannot be said of Mr
Dixon's book that it is either dull or
insipid; it has some of the elements
of popularity; but we cannot better
describe it in a few words than by
saying that it is a <em>caricature</em> of a
popular biography. Its flippancy, its
conceit, its egregious pretensions, its
tawdry <em>novelistic</em> style, are past all
sufferance. It is too bad to criticise.
But as, in the dearth of any popular
biography of Howard, it has assumed
for a time a position it by no means
merits, we cannot pass it by entirely
without notice. For, besides that
Mr Dixon writes throughout with
execrable taste, he has not dealt
conscientiously with the materials
before him. His notion of the duty
of a biographer is this&mdash;that he is to
collect every incident of the least
piquancy, no matter by whom related,
or on what authority, and colour it
himself as highly as he can. Evidently
the most serious preparation
he has made, for writing the life of
Howard, has been a course of reading
in French romances. It is with the
spirit and manner of a Eugene Sue
that he sits down to describe the
grand and simple career of Howard.</p>

<p>Mr Dixon has not added a single
new fact to the biography of Howard,
nor any novelty whatever, except such
as he has drawn from his own imagination.
Nor does he assist in sifting
the narrative; on the contrary, whatever
dust has the least sparkle in it,
though it has been thrice thrown away,
he assiduously collects. That he
should have nothing new to relate is
no matter of blame; it is probable
that no future biographer will be able
to do more than recast and reanimate
the materials to be found in Brown
and Aikin. But why this pretence of
having written a life of Howard from
"original documents?" We beg pardon:
he does not absolutely say that
he has written <em>the Life of Howard</em> from
original documents&mdash;the original
document, for there is but one, may
apply to the "<em>prison-world of
Europe</em>," of which also he professes
to write. This "earliest document
of any value connected with the
<em>penology of England</em>," which, with
much parade, he prints for the first
time, relates to the state of prisons
before the labours of Howard. Impossible
to suppose, therefore, that
Mr Hepworth Dixon meant his readers
to infer that, by the aid of this document,
he was about to give them an
original Life of Howard.</p>

<p>Let us look at Mr Dixon's preface&mdash;it
is worth while. It thus commences:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Several reasons combined to induce
the writer <em>to undertake the work of making
out for the reading world</em> a new biography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of Howard; the chief of them fell under
two heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<em>It lay in his path.</em> Years ago now,
circumstances, which do not require to be
explained in this place, called his attention
to the vast subject of the <em>prison-world</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>We must stop a moment to admire
this favourite magniloquence of our
author. Howard wrote a report on
the state of prisons; Mr Dixon writes
on nothing less than the <em>prison-world</em>
of Europe! He heads his chapters&mdash;"The
Prison-world of the Continent,"
"The Prison-world of England." If
Mr Dixon, in his patriotic labours,
should turn his attention to the
nuisance of Smithfield market, he
would certainly give us a treatise on
"The <em>Butcher-world</em> of Europe," with
chapters headed, with due logical gradation,
"The Butcher-world of England,"
and "The Butcher-world of
London."</p>

<p>"It lay in his path," was one reason
why he wrote his biography.
"It needed to be done," was the
other. We agree in the last of these
reasons, whatever demur we make to
the first. A more popular biography
than Mr Brown's would certainly be a
useful book. But what can Mr Dixon
mean by saying, that, "although
Howard was the father of prison-science,
the story of his life has
hitherto been made out without reference
to that fact?" Messrs Brown
and Aikin were not, then, aware that
the excitement of the public attention
to the great subject of prison-discipline
was the chief result, and the
direct and ostensible aim of the labours
of Howard!</p>

<p>But now we arrive at Mr Dixon's
statement of his own peculiar resources
for writing the Life of Howard, and
the valuable contributions he has
made to our better knowledge of the
man; in short, his claims upon our
gratitude and confidence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It has been the writer's study to
render this biographical history of Howard
as worthy of its subject, and of the confidence
of the reader, as the nature of the
materials at his disposal would allow.
He has carefully collated every document
already printed&mdash;made, and caused to be
made, numerous researches&mdash;conversed
with persons who have preserved traditions
and other memorials of this subject&mdash;travelled
in his traces over a great
number of prisons&mdash;examined parliamentary
and other records for such new
facts as they might afford&mdash;and, in conclusion,
has consulted these several sources
of information, and interpreted their
answers by such light as his personal
experience of the prison-world suggested
to be needful. The result of this labour
is, that some new matter of curious interest
has turned up&mdash;<em>amongst other
things</em>, a manuscript throwing light on
the early history of prison reforms in this
country, found in the archives of the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge,
and for which he is indebted to
the courtesy of the secretary, the Rev. T.
B. Murray; and the writer is assured
<em>that no other papers</em> exist in any known
quarter. The material for Howard's life
is therefore <em>now fully collected</em>; whether
it is herein finally used, will entirely
depend upon the verdict of the reader."</p></blockquote>

<p>From all this mystification, the
reader is at least to conclude that
something very important has been
done, and contributions very valuable
have been made, for a final biography
of Howard. Documents collated&mdash;researches
made, and caused to be
made&mdash;then a discovered manuscript,
which now is, and now is not, appertaining
to the subject&mdash;assurance
"that no other papers exist in any
known quarter!"&mdash;"materials <em>now</em>
fully collected!" Oh, Admirable
Crichton! Our author has done all
this for us! Our author has read the
memoirs of Baldwin Brown&mdash;and that
not very attentively: if he has done
more it is a pity, because there is not
the least trace of it in his book. Our
author has read the memoirs of
Baldwin Brown, and travestied his
narrative, and then writes this preface,
as a travesty, we presume, of erudite
prefaces in general. The book altogether
does not belong to literature,
but is a sort of parody upon literature.</p>

<p>We may as well give our readers
the benefit of the rest of the preface:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The mental and moral portraiture of
Howard attempted in this volume is new."
[Fortunately, and to the recommendation
of the volume, it is not new, but a transcript
of that which his predecessor had
drawn.] "As the writer's method of
inquiry and of treatment was different to
that ordinarily adopted, so his result is
different. His study of the character was
earnest, and, he believes, faithful. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
making himself master of all the facts of
the case which have come down to us,
biographically and traditionally, his plan
was to <em>saturate himself with Howardian
ideas</em>, and then strive to reproduce them
<em>living, acting, and suffering</em> in the real
world."</p></blockquote>

<p>How the Howardian ideas <em>suffered</em>
from this process, we can somewhat
guess. The rest of the sentence is not
so plain:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The writer lays down his pen, not
without regret. Long accustomed to
contemplate one of the most noble and
beautiful characters in history, he has
learnt to regard it with a human affection;
and at parting with his theme&mdash;the
mental companion of many hours, and the
object of his constant thoughts&mdash;<em>he feels
somewhat like a father who gives away his
favourite daughter in marriage</em>. He does
not lose his interest in his child; but she
can be to him no longer what she has
been. A touch of melancholy mingles
with his joy. He still regards his offspring
with a tender solicitude&mdash;<em>but his
monopoly of love is ended</em>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, surely no!</p>

<p>We propose, as far as our limits
will permit, to retrace the chief incidents
in the biography of Howard.
A brief sketch of his life and character
may not be unacceptable to our readers.
Such strictures as we have passed
upon his latest biographer, Mr Dixon,
we shall have abundant opportunities
to justify as we proceed.</p>

<p>The well-known monument in St
Paul's Cathedral, which, from the
circumstance of the key held in the
hand of the statue, has been sometimes
taken by foreigners for the representation
of the apostle St Peter, bears
inscribed on the pedestal that Howard
"was born in Hackney, in the county
of Middlesex, September 2, 1726."
But both the place and the year of
his birth have been differently stated
by his biographers. The Rev. S.
Palmer, who had known him long,
writes that he was born at Clapton;
Dr Aikin, that he was born at Enfield.
To the authority of the Doctor,
on such a point as this, we attach no
weight; it is plain to us that he gave
himself little trouble to determine
whether he was born at Clapton or
Enfield. It was probably at Clapton;
but Clapton is in the parish of Hackney,
so that there is really no discrepancy
between Mr Palmer's statement
and that on the monument. The
year 1726 seems also to be generally
received as the most probable date of
his birth. After all the discussion, we
may as well adhere to the inscription
on the pedestal of the statue.</p>

<p>The father of Howard had acquired
a considerable fortune in business as
an upholsterer and carpet warehouseman
in Long Lane, Smithfield. He
was a dissenter, of Calvinistic principles;
and, it is presumed, an Independent.
The question has been
raised, whether our Howard was
descended from any branch of the
noble family of that name; but his
biographers generally agree in rejecting
for him the honours of such a
pedigree. Nor can any one be in the
least degree solicitous to advance
such a claim. The military achievements
of a Norman ancestry would
diffuse a very incongruous lustre over
the name of our Christian philanthropist.
Thus much, however, is
evident, that at one time there existed
some tradition, or belief, or pretence,
in the family of the citizen Howard,
that they were remotely connected
with the noble family whose name
they share. "The arms of the Duke
of Norfolk, and of the Earls of Suffolk,
Effingham, and Carlisle, are placed at
the head of the tombstone which
Howard erected to the memory of his
first wife, on the south side of Whitechapel
churchyard." Such is the assertion
of the anonymous biographer in
the <cite>Universal Magazine</cite>, (vol. lxxxvi.)
who stands alone, we believe, in maintaining
the validity of this claim. And
Mr Brown, after quoting these words,
adds&mdash;"From actual inspection of
the mouldering monument, I can assure
those of my readers who may feel
any curiosity on the subject, that
this description of its armorial bearings
is correct; and am further enabled
to add, on the authority of his relative,
Mr Barnardiston, that the distinguished
individual by whom that
monument was erected, occasionally
spoke of Lord Carlisle as his relative;
thus claiming at least a traditional
descent from the Howards, Earls of
Suffolk." That such a man as Howard
should have used these arms <em>once</em> is
significant; that he should have used
them only once, is equally so. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was one of the last men, if we have
read his character correctly, who
would have assumed what he did not,
at the time, think himself entitled to;
and one of the last who would shrink
from claiming a right where his title
was clear.</p>

<p>Mr Dixon not only rejects the
claim, but is highly indignant that
it should ever have been suggested.
"Howard sprang from a virgin and
undistinguished soil;"&mdash;why the upholsterer's
should be peculiarly <em>a virgin
soil</em> we do not see. "Attempts,
however, have not been wanting to
<em>vulgarise</em> his origin&mdash;to rob its greatness
of its most natural charm&mdash;by
circling his brows with the <em>distant
glitter</em> of a ducal crown; by finding in
his simple lineaments the trace of
noble lines, and in his veins the consecrated
currents of patrician blood."
Strange waste of eloquent indignation!
But he does not keep quite
steady in his passion. "No," he
exclaims, "let Howard stand alone.
His reputation rests upon a basis
already broad enough. <em>Why should
we pile up Pelion on Olympus?</em>" There
was, then, a Pelion to pile upon Olympus?
We had thought not. Our
author should have kept these red and
purple patches at a greater distance:
they do not harmonise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the father of Howard had
so little of what is commonly called
aristocratic pride, that although he
had retired from business, and had a
good property&mdash;and property, too, in
land&mdash;to leave to his son, he yet
wished that son to tread in his own
footsteps. He apprenticed him to a
wholesale grocer in Watling Street.</p>

<p>The education of young Howard
was such as is, or was, generally given
to a lad of respectable parents intended
for trade. He was at two
schools. Of the first, Howard himself
is reported to have said, that,
having been there seven years, "he
left it not fully taught in any one
thing." He left it when a boy, and
what boy ever left his school "fully
taught in any one thing?" The remark
is rather characteristic of the
speaker than condemnatory of John
Worsley, the schoolmaster in question.
His second school was kept by
a Mr Eames, a man of acknowledged
ability. But how long he remained
there is not known. At this school
he made the friendship of one Price,
afterwards that Dr Price who remains,
to all posterity, impaled in Burke's
<cite>Letter on the French Revolution</cite>. The
great orator thrust his spear through
his thin texture, and pinned him to
the board; and never, but in this rich
museum, will any one behold or think
of Dr Price. Perhaps he deserved a
better fate, but his case is hopeless
now. Yet, if it can heal his memory
to connect his name with one who was
not a <em>revolutionary philanthropist</em>, let
him have all the benefit of the association.
Howard had never acquired
the art of writing his own language
with ease and correctness, and therefore
it will be directly understood
how valuable to him, in the preparation
of his reports, was the help of a
literary friend. That literary friend
he found in Dr Price. In a letter to
him, Howard writes, "It is from your
kind aid and assistance, my dear
friend, that I derive so much of my
character and influence. I exult in
declaring it, and shall carry a grateful
sense of it to the last hour of my
existence."</p>

<p>After his father's death, Howard
purchased his freedom from the wholesale
grocer's in Watling Street, and
travelled upon the Continent. He
was not without taste for the arts;
and it was at this time, Mr Brown
supposes, that he brought with him
from Italy those paintings with which
he afterwards embellished his favourite
seat at Cardington.</p>

<p>On returning from this tour, he
took lodgings at Stoke Newington, in
the house of Mrs Loidore, a widow,
upwards of fifty, of rather humble
station in life, and a perpetual invalid.
She, however, nursed him with so
much care, through a severe illness, by
which he was attacked while residing
under her roof, that, on his recovery,
he offered her marriage. "Against
this unexpected proposal," says Mr
Brown, "the lady made remonstrances,
principally upon the
ground of the great disparity in their
ages; but Mr Howard being firm to
his purpose, the union took place, it
is believed, in the year 1752, he being
then in about the twenty-fifth year
of his age, and his bride in her
fifty-second. Upon this occasion, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
behaved with a liberality which seems
to have been inherent in his nature,
by settling the whole of his wife's
little independence upon her sister.
The marriage, thus singularly contracted,
was productive of mutual
satisfaction to the parties who entered
it. Mrs Howard was a woman of
excellent character, amiable in her
disposition, sincere in her piety, endowed
with a good mental capacity,
and forward in exercising its powers
in every good word and work."</p>

<p>Thus runs the sober narrative of Mr
Brown. Not so does Mr Dixon let
pass the opportunity for fine descriptive
writing. Read and admire:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"As he became convalescent, his plan
ripened into form. When the danger had
entirely passed away, his health was restored
to its accustomed state; he offered
her, as the only fitting reward of her
services&mdash;a toy? an ornament? a purse?
a house? an estate? or any of those
munificent gifts with which wealthy and
generous convalescents reward their favourite
attendants? No. He offered
her his hand, his name, his fortune! Of
course, the good lady was astonished at
the portentous shape of her patient's
gratitude. She started objections, being
older, and having more worldly prudence
than her lover. It is even said that she
seriously refused her consent to the
match, urging the various arguments
which might fairly be alleged against it,&mdash;the
inequality in the years, fortune,
social position of the parties, and so
forth&mdash;but all to no purpose. Howard's
mind was made up. During his slow
recovery, he had weighed the matter
carefully&mdash;had come to the conclusion
that it was his duty to marry her, and
nothing could now change his determination.
The struggle between the two
must have been extremely curious: the
sense of duty on both sides, founded upon
honest convictions, no doubt,&mdash;the mutual
respect without the consuming fire,&mdash;the
cool and logical weighing of arguments,
in place of the rapid pleading of triumphant
passion; the young man without the
ordinary inspirations of youth, on the
one hand; the widow, past her prime, yet
simple, undesigning, unambitious, earnestly
struggling to reject and put aside
youth, wealth, protection, honour, social
rank,&mdash;the very things for which women
are taught to dress, to pose, to intrigue,
almost to circumvent heaven, on the
other;&mdash;form together a picture which
has its romantic interest, in spite of the
incongruity of the main idea. Humble
life is not without its heroic acts. <em>Cæsar
refusing the Roman crown</em>, even had he
been really serious, and without after-thought
in its rejection, <em>is a paltry piece
of magnanimity, compared with Mrs
Loidore's refusal of the hand of Howard</em>.
At length, however, her resistance was
overcome by the indomitable will of her
suitor. One of the contemporary biographers
has thrown an air of romance over
the scene of this domestic struggle, which,
if the lady had been young and beautiful&mdash;that
is, if the element of passion could
be admitted into the arena&mdash;would have
been truly charming. As it is, the reader
may receive it with such modifications as
he or she may deem necessary. 'On the
very first opportunity,' says this grave
but imaginative chronicler, 'Mr Howard
expressed his sentiments to her in the
strongest terms of affection, assuring her
that, if she rejected his proposal, <em>he would
become an exile for ever to his family
and friends</em>. The lady was upwards of
forty [true enough! she was also upwards
of fifty, good master historian,] and
therefore urged the disagreement of
their years, as well as their circumstances;
but, after <em>allowing her four-and-twenty
hours for a final reply</em>, his eloquence
surmounted all her objections,
and she consented to a union wherein
gratitude was to supply the deficiencies
of passion!' Criticism would only spoil
the pretty picture&mdash;so let it stand."</p></blockquote>

<p>Criticism had already spoilt the
picture, such as it is. But this matters
not to Mr Dixon. The quotation
he has thought fit to embellish
his pages with, is taken from an
anonymous pamphlet published in
1790, under the title of <cite>The Life of
the late John Howard, Esquire, with a
Review of his Travels</cite>. Mr Dixon,
however, evidently extracts it second-hand
from the note in Mr Brown,
where it is quoted, with some other
passages from the same performance,
for the express purpose of refutation
and contradiction. This is what Mr
Dixon would call <em>artistic</em>&mdash;the picking
up what had been discarded as worthless,
and, with a gentle shade of doubt
thrown over its authenticity, making
use of it again.</p>

<p>A note of Mr Brown's, in the same
page of his memoirs, (p. 634,) will
supply us with another instance of
this ingenious procedure. That note
runs thus:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We are informed in the memoirs of
Mr Howard, published in the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>, that, during the period of his
residing as a lodger in the house of Mrs
Loidore, he used to ride out in the morning
for a few miles with a book in his
pocket, dismount, turn his horse to graze
upon a common, and spend several hours
in reading. 'On a very particular inquiry,
however,' says the author of the
<cite>Life of Mr Howard</cite>, inserted in the
<cite>Universal Magazine</cite>, 'of persons very
intimate, and who had often rode out
with him, we are assured that they never
saw, nor ever <em>heard</em> of such a practice.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr Dixon makes use of the first
part of the note, ignoring the second.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It is said," he writes, gravely suspending
his judgment on the authenticity
of the fact&mdash;"it is said, in a contemporary
biographical notice, that he would frequently
ride out a mile or two in the
country, fasten his nag to a tree, or turn
him loose to browse upon the way-side;
and then, throwing himself upon the
grass, under a friendly shade, would read
and cogitate for hours. This statement,
if true, would indicate more of a romantic
and poetical temperament in Howard,
than the generally calm and Christian
stoicism of his manner would have led
one to expect."</p></blockquote>

<p>That Mr Dixon never consulted the
memoir itself, in the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>, we shall by-and-by have
an opportunity of showing. That
memoir, worthless as an authority,
has become notorious for the calumny
it originated. But this collator of
documents, this inquirer after traditions,
this maker of unimaginable researches,
has never turned over the
pages of the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite> for
that obituary which, owing to its
slanderous attack, has excited so much
controversy in all the biographies of
Howard, his own included.</p>

<p>This wife, so singularly selected,
died two or three years after her marriage.
Howard is again free and
solitary, and again betakes himself to
travel. We are in the year 1755, and
the great earthquake of Lisbon has
laid that city in ruins. He goes to
see the grand and terrific spectacle.
Dr Aikin calls it a sublime curiosity.
We presume that no other motive
than curiosity impelled him on this
occasion; it would be certainly very
difficult to suggest any other. No
difficulties, however, daunt Mr Dixon.
According to him,&mdash;"Howard, attracted
by reports of the unexampled
sufferings of the survivors, no sooner
found himself at his own disposal,
than he determined to haste with all
possible speed to their assistance!"
Single-handed, he was to cope with the
earthquake.</p>

<p>Lisbon, however, he was not fated
to reach. The vessel he sailed in was
taken by a French privateer, and he,
with the rest of the passengers and
crew, carried into Brest, and there
retained prisoner of war. The calamities
of imprisonment he here endured
himself, and under no mild form:
afterwards, when other circumstances
had drawn his attention to the condition
of the prisoners, the remembrance
of his own sufferings came in aid of
his compassion for others. "Perhaps,"
he says, in the preface to his
first report, "what I suffered on this
occasion increased my sympathy with
the unhappy people, whose case is the
subject of this book."</p>

<p>Released upon parole, he returned
to England, obtained his exchange,
and then sat himself down on his
estate at Cardington. Here he occupied
himself in plans to ameliorate the
condition of his tenantry. Scientific
studies, and the study of medicine, to
which, from time to time, he had applied
himself, also engaged his attention.
It was at this period he was
elected a member of the Royal Society,
not assuredly, as Mr Thomas Taylor
presumes, from the "value attached"
to a few communications upon the
state of the weather, but, as Dr
Aikin sensibly tells us, "in conformity
to the laudable practice of that society,
of attaching gentlemen of fortune
and leisure to the interests of knowledge,
by incorporating them into
that body."</p>

<p>Howard now entered into matrimony
a second time. On the 25th
April 1758, he married Henrietta
Leeds, second daughter of Edward
Leeds, Esq. of Croxton, in Cambridgeshire.
This alliance is pronounced by
all his biographers to be in every respect
suitable. Parity of age, harmony
of sentiment, and, on the part of the
lady, the charms of person and amiability
of temper, everything contributed
to a happy union. And it was
so. Unfortunately, the happiness
was as brief as it seems to have been
perfect. His second wife also expired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
after a few years,&mdash;"the only years,"
Howard himself has said, "of true
enjoyment he had known in life."</p>

<p>On this occasion, Mr Dixon, after
infusing into Howard "the bland and
insinuating witchery of a virgin passion,"
proceeds to describe his Henrietta
in the most approved language
of the novelist: "Although her features
were not cast in the choicest
mould of Grecian beauty, she was
very fair&mdash;had large impressive eyes,
an ample brow, a mouth exquisitely
<em>cut</em>," &amp;c. Shall we never again get
the chisel out of the human face?</p>

<p>Connected with this second marriage
of Howard, his biographers relate
a trait of character which will be differently
estimated by different minds&mdash;we
relate it in the words of Mr
Dixon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"We must not omit an incident that
occurred before the ceremony, which is
very significant of Howard's frankness
and firmness at this epoch. Observing
that many unpleasantnesses arise in families,
from circumstances trifling in themselves,
in consequence of each individual
wishing to have his own way in all things,
he determined to avoid all these sources
of domestic discord, by establishing his
own paramount authority in the first instance.
It is just conceivable that his
former experience of the wedded life may
have led him to insist upon this condition.
At all events, he stipulated with
Henrietta, <em>that, in all matters in which
there should be a difference of opinion between
them, his voice should rule</em>. This
may sound very ungallant in terms, but
it was found exceedingly useful in practice.
Few men would have the moral
honesty to suggest such an arrangement
to their lady-loves at such a season;
though, at the same time, few would
hesitate to make the largest mental reservations
in their own behalf. It may
also be, that few young belles would be
disposed to treat such a proposition otherwise
than with ridicule and anger, however
conscious <em>they</em> might be, that as soon
as the hymeneal pageantries were passed,
their surest means of happiness would lie
in the prompt adoption of the principle so
laid down.</p>

<p>"Would that men and women would
become sincerer with each other! The
great social vice of this age is its untrustfulness."</p></blockquote>

<p>And Mr Dixon thereupon launches
into we know not what heroics upon
etiquette, upon English law, morals,
and the constitution, all <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à propos</i> of
Henrietta's obedience! For our own
part, we do not look with much respect
upon this stipulation which calls forth
the admiration of Mr Dixon, and apparently
meets with his cordial sympathy.
Such a stipulation would probably
be a mere nullity; with, or
without it, the stronger will would predominate;
but if we are to suppose
it a really binding obligation, forming
the basis of the conjugal union, it presents
to us anything but an attractive
aspect. It was the harsh feature in
Howard's character, or the mistaken
principle that he had adopted&mdash;this
love of an authority&mdash;this claim to a
domestic absolutism&mdash;which was to
give no reasons, and admit of no
questioning.</p>

<p>In justice to the character of Howard,
we must not leave this matter entirely
in the hands of Mr Dixon.
Everything he draws is, more or less,
a caricature. The authority on which
his narration is founded is the following
statement of the Rev. S. Palmer,
given in Brown, p. 55:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The truth is," says Mr Palmer, in his
manuscript memoir of his distinguished
friend, "he had a high idea (some of his
friends may think, too high) of the
authority of the head of a family. And
he thought it right, because most convenient,
to maintain it, for the sake of
avoiding the unhappy consequences of
domestic disputes. On this principle I
have more than once heard him <em>pleasantly
relate</em> the agreement he made with the
last Mrs Howard, previous to their marriage,
that, <em>to prevent all altercation about
those little matters</em> which he had observed
to be the chief grounds of uneasiness in
families, he should always decide. To
this the amiable lady readily consented,
and ever adhered. Nor did she ever
regret the agreement, which she found to
be attended with the happiest effects.
Such was the opinion she entertained,
both of his wisdom and his goodness, that
she perfectly acquiesced in all that he
did, and no lady ever appeared happier
in the conjugal bonds."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here the matter has a much less
repulsive aspect than in Mr Dixon's
version, who has, in fact, exaggerated,
in his zeal, a trait of Howard's character,
which his best friends seem
always to have looked upon with more
or less of regret and disapproval.</p>

<p>As the only other circumstance connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
with Howard's domestic life
which we shall have space to mention,
has also a peculiar reference to
this trait in his character, we will
depart from the chronological order of
events, and allude to it here. His
last wife left him one child, a son.
This son grew up a dissolute youth;
his ill-regulated life led to disease, and
disease terminated in insanity. To
this last malady, Mr Brown tells us
he is authorised to say that there was
a hereditary predisposition&mdash;we presume
he means upon the mother's
side.</p>

<p>Immediately on the death of Howard,
there appeared, amongst the obituaries
of the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>, a memoir
of the deceased, in which the
miserable fate of the son is directly
charged upon the severity of the
father. The whole memoir is full of
errors. For this, the extreme haste
in which it was necessarily written
forms an excuse. But no excuse can
be given for the perverse and malignant
spirit it betrays. The very
next number of the magazine opens
with four or five letters addressed to
Mr Urban, all remonstrating against,
and refuting this baseless calumny;
and every biographer has felt himself
compelled to notice and repel the
slander.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the writer or writers
of the memoir&mdash;for several were engaged
in concocting this very hasty
and wretched performance&mdash;were quite
ignorant, both of the education the
son had received, and of the profligate
course, and the consequent derangement
of his health into which he had
fallen. They knew only that the son
was in a lunatic asylum, and that the
father was a severe disciplinarian; and
they most unwarrantably combined
the two together, in the relation of
cause and effect. "All prospects,"
they say, speaking of the youth,
"were blasted by paternal severity,
which reduced the young man to such
an unhappy situation as to require his
being placed where he now is, or
lately was."</p>

<p>The vindication of Howard from
this slander is complete; the origin
of the son's malady is clearly traced;
his affection for his child is amply demonstrated,
and his unceasing anxiety
to train him to virtue and piety is
made equally manifest. But his
most intimate friends entertained the
opinion that his conduct towards his
son was not <em>judicious</em>, and that his
method of training up the youth was
by no means so wisely, as it was conscientiously
adopted. This is the sole
charge, if such it can be called, to
which the father is obnoxious; nor,
from this, do we pretend to acquit
him.</p>

<p>"It is agreed, on all hands," says
Mr Brown, "that Howard entertained
the most exalted notions of the
authority of the head of a family&mdash;notions
derived rather from the Scriptural
history of patriarchal times than
from any of our modern codes of
ethics, or systems of education." Accordingly,
we are told that he trained
up his child from earliest infancy to an
implicit obedience. Without once
striking the child, but by manifesting
a firmness of purpose which it was
hopeless to think of shaking, he established
such an authority over him
that Howard himself, on one occasion,
said, that "if he told the boy to
put his finger in the fire, he believed
he would do it." When he was an
infant, and cried from passion, the
father took him, laid him quietly in
his lap, neither spoke nor moved,
but let him cry on till he was wearied.
"This process, a few times repeated,
had such an effect, that the child, if
crying ever so violently, was rendered
quiet the instant his father took him."
When he grew older, the severest
punishment his father inflicted was to
make him sit still in his presence,
without speaking, for a time proportioned
to the nature of the offence.
But this impassive, statue-like firmness
must have precluded all approach
to companionship or confidence on the
part of the son. It was still the obedience
only of fear. "His friends,"
we quote from Mr Brown, "and
amongst the rest the most intimate of
them, the Rev. Mr Smith, thought
that in the case of his son he carried
those patriarchal ideas rather too
far, and that by a lad of his temper
(the son is described as of a lively disposition)
he would have been more
respected, and would have possessed
more real authority over him, had he
attempted to convince him of the reasonableness
of his commands, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of always enforcing obedience to them
on his parental authority." We therefore
may be permitted to say, that we
look upon this aspect of Howard's
character as by no means estimable.
As a husband he claimed an unjust
prerogative, and as a parent he
divorced authority from persuasion,
nor allowed obedience to mingle and
ally itself with filial affection.</p>

<p>Mr Dixon does not, of course, omit
his tribute of indignation against the
calumny of the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>.
We said that he had not given himself
the trouble to look at the memoir
itself which he denounces. Here is
the proof:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The atrocious slander to which reference
is made," says Mr Dixon, "was
promulgated in the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>,
in an obituary notice of the philanthropist.
The charge was made <em>on the strength
of one asserted fact</em>&mdash;namely, that Howard
had once locked up his son for several
hours in a solitary place, put the key
into his pocket, and gone off to Bedford,
leaving him there till he returned at
night. On the appearance of this article,
the friends of the illustrious dead came
forth publicly to dispute the fact, and to
deny the inferences deduced from it.
Meredith Townsend, one of Howard's
most intimate friends, sifted the story to
the bottom, and gave the following
account of its origin."</p></blockquote>

<p>The charge was <em>not</em> made on the
strength of this one asserted fact&mdash;nor
on any fact whatever&mdash;it was made
on the mere authority of the writer.
The story alluded to is <em>not to be found</em>
in the obituary of the <cite>Gentleman's
Magazine</cite>. The writers of that obituary
had never heard of the story, or
we may be sure they would have made
use of it. The friends of the illustrious
dead could not, therefore, have
come forward, in refutation of this
article, to "dispute the fact and deny
the inferences." If Mr Dixon had
but read Brown's memoirs attentively
he would not have fallen into this
blunder, which shows how little else
he can have read.</p>

<p>The story alluded to had been circulated
during the life of Howard, and
when he was absent on one of his
journeys. The Rev. Mr Townsend,
"many years Mr Howard's pastor at
Stoke Newington," took the first
opportunity <em>he</em> had of mentioning it to
Howard himself, who contradicted it,
and related to him the incident which
he supposed must have given rise to
the report. On the death of Howard
the story was again revived, where, or
by whom, Mr Brown does not tell us.
The Rev. Mr Palmer thereupon obtained
from Mr Townsend the explanation
which he had received from
Howard himself. The letter which
the latter gentleman addressed to the
Rev. Mr Palmer is given at length in
Brown, (note, p. 645.) This letter
the Rev. Mr Palmer communicates
to the <cite>Editor of the Universal Magazine</cite>,
and mentions that extracts from
it, unauthorised by him, had found
their way into the <cite>Gentleman's Magazine</cite>.</p>

<p>The explanation of the story there
given, is briefly this. Howard was
engaged one day with his child in the
root-house, which served also as a
summer-house, when the servant came
in great haste, to say that a gentleman
on horseback wished to speak to him
immediately. Not to lose time, he
told the little fellow to sit quiet, and
he would soon come to him again. To
keep him out of mischief he locked the
door. The gentleman kept him in
conversation longer than he expected,
and caused his forgetting the child.
Upon the departure of the guest, recollecting
where the child had been
left, he flew to set him at liberty, and
found him quietly sleeping on the matting
of the floor.</p>

<p>It was on the 31st March 1765 that
Howard lost his second wife. After
spending some time in the now melancholy
retirement of Cardington, he
again quits England for the Continent.
Travel is still with him, as with so
many others, the mere relief for unavailing
sorrow, or for the wasting
disease of unemployed energies. It is
during this journey to Italy that we
are able to trace, more distinctly than
usual, the workings of Howard's mind.
Some memoranda, and fragments of a
diary which he kept, have given us
this insight.</p>

<p>It was his design to proceed to the
south of Italy. He stops at Turin.
He is dissatisfied with himself. This
life of sight-seeing, this vagrancy of
the tourist, does not content him. He
will go no further. But we must give
the extract itself from his journal.
We quote from the more faithful text<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of Mr Brown&mdash;Mr Dixon having the
habit of omitting, here and there, a
sentence if it does not please his taste,
and tricking the whole out with dashes
and a novel punctuation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<em>Turin, 1769, Nov. 30.</em>&mdash;My return
without seeing the southern part of Italy
was on much deliberation, as I feared a
misimprovement of a Talent spent for
mere curiosity, at the loss of many Sabbaths,
and as many donations must be
suspended for my pleasure, which would
have been as I hope contrary to the general
conduct of my Life, and which on a
retrospective view on a death Bed would
cause Pain as unbecoming a Disciple of
Christ&mdash;whose mind should be formed in
my soul.&mdash;These thoughts, with distance
from my dear boy, determine me to check
my curiosity and be on the return.&mdash;Oh,
why should Vanity and Folly, Pictures
and Baubles, or even the stupendious (<em>sic</em>)
mountains, beautiful hills, or rich valleys,
which ere long will all be consumed, engross
the thoughts of a candidate for an
eternal everlasting kingdom&mdash;a worm
ever to crawl on Earth whom God has
raised to the hope of Glory which ere
long will be revealed to them which are
washed and sanctified by Faith in the
blood of the Divine Redeemer! Look
forward, oh! my Soul! how low, how
mean, how little is everything but what
has a view to that glorious World of
Light, Life, and Love&mdash;the Preparation
of the Heart is of God&mdash;Prepare the Heart,
Oh! God! of thy unworthy Creature, and
unto Thee be all the glory through the
boundless ages of Eternity.</p>

<p class="sig">
Sign'd J. H.
</p>

<p>"This night my trembling soul almost
longs to take its flight to see and know
the wonders of redeeming Love&mdash;join the
triumphant Choir&mdash;Sin and Sorrow fled
away&mdash;God my Redeemer all in all&mdash;Oh!
happy Spirits that are safe in those mansions."</p></blockquote>

<p>Accordingly he retraces his steps.
He flies back to Holland. He is now
at the Hague. It is Sunday evening,
11th February 1770. Here is a portion
of his self-communing. Many of
these quotations we will not give; we
know they look out of place, and produce
a strange, and not an agreeable
impression, when met with in the
walks of polite literature. But, without
some extracts, it is impossible to form a
correct idea of the character of Howard.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Oh! the wonders of redeeming love!
Some faint hope, even I! through redeeming
mercy in the perfect righteousness&mdash;the
full atoning sacrifice shall, ere
long, be made the instrument of the rich
free grace and mercy of God through the
divine Redeemer. Oh, shout my soul
grace, grace&mdash;free, sovereign, rich, unbounded
grace! Not I, not I, an ill deserving,
hell deserving creature!&mdash;but
where sin has abounded, I trust grace
superabounds. * * * *</p>

<p>"Let not, my soul, the interests of a
moment engross thy thoughts, or be preferred
to my eternal interests. Look
forward to that glory which will be revealed
to those who are faithful to death.
My soul, walk thou with God; be faithful,
hold on, hold out, and then&mdash;what
words can utter!&mdash;J. H."</p></blockquote>

<p>But he could not rest in Holland.
"Continuing in Holland," he writes,
"or any place, lowers my spirits."
He returns to Italy. He visits Genoa,
Pisa, Florence, Rome, and extends
his tour to Naples.</p>

<p>It was, and may still be, a custom
with a certain class of religious people,
to make, in writing, a solemn
covenant with God, and sign it with
their own hand. It is at Naples that
Howard retires into his chamber, indites
and signs such a covenant. He
appears, afterwards, to have carried
it with him. With the same sort of
formality with which a person republishes
a will, he "renews the covenant,
Moscow, September 27, 1789."</p>

<p>Through the remainder of this journey
we need not follow him. He
returns to England, and we see what
sort of man has landed on its shores.</p>

<p>Those who are acquainted with
the religious world and religious biographies,
will bear us out when
we say, that the language we have
quoted from this journal, and the
other extracts which may be read in
Brown, would not, <em>of themselves</em>, manifest
any extraordinary degree of piety
or self-devotion. With a certain class
of persons, such language has become
<em>habitual</em>; with others, it really expresses
nothing but a very transitory
state of excitement. Solemn self-denunciations&mdash;enthusiastic
raptures&mdash;we
have heard them both, from the
lips of the most worldly, selfish,
money-loving men we have ever
known. It is the after life of Howard
which proves that in him such language
had its first, genuine, full meaning.
These passages from his diary
explain his life, and his life no less
explains them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>On his return to Cardington, he occupied
himself, as before, with plans
to improve the condition of his tenantry;
building for them better houses,
and erecting a school. But at length
an event occurred which supplied his
self-consuming energy with the noble
task it craved. Elected High Sheriff
for the county of Bedford, the duties
of his office led him to the interior of
the prison. He witnessed the sufferings,
the extortion, the injustice, the
manifold cruelty, which the supineness
of the legislature allowed to reign and
riot there.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The distress of prisoners," he tells
us, in the preface to his first report,
"came more immediately under my notice,
when I was sheriff of the county of
Bedford; and the circumstance which
excited me to activity in their behalf was
the seeing some, who, by the verdict of
juries, were declared <em>not guilty</em>; some,
on whom the grand jury did not find such
an appearance of guilt as subjected them
to trial; and some, whose prosecutors
did not appear against them; after having
been confined for months, dragged
back to jail, and locked up again, till
they should pay <em>sundry fees</em> to the jailor,
the clerk of assize, &amp;c. In order to redress
this hardship, I applied to the justices
of the county for a salary to the
jailor in lieu of his fees. The bench were
properly affected with the grievance, and
willing to grant the relief desired; but
they wanted a precedent for charging the
county with the expense. I, therefore,
rode into several neighbouring counties
in search of a precedent; but I soon
learned that the same injustice was practised
in them; and, looking into the prisons,
I beheld scenes of calamity, which
I grew daily more and more anxious to
alleviate."</p></blockquote>

<p>These oppressions, these calamities
he dragged to light. He may be said
to have <em>discovered</em> them&mdash;so indifferent,
at this time, was one class of the
community to the misery of another.
His official position gave him just that
elevation requisite to make his voice
heard. The attention of parliament
was roused. He was examined before
a committee of the whole House; he
received the thanks of parliament;
and a bill was passed to remunerate
the jailor by a salary, instead of by
fees&mdash;thus remedying one of the most
extraordinary mal-practices that was
surely ever endured in a civilised
society.</p>

<p>Here, then, was a task to strain all
his powers, and absorb all his benevolence.
Here was misery to be alleviated,
and injustice to be redressed,
and a nation to be aroused from its
culpable negligence. Benevolent,
liberal, systematically and perseveringly
charitable, not averse to the
exercise of authority and censorship,
of restless and untameable energy,
and of a singular constancy and firmness
of purpose, the task employed
all his virtues, and what in some
positions of life would have proved
to be his failings. Even to his love
of travel, his new occupation suited
him. What wonder that, with all
these aptitudes, the <em>religious man</em>,
devoured by his desire to do some
good and great work, should have
devoted to it his life and his fortune,
his days and his nights, and every
faculty of his soul. He had now
found his path. His foot was on it;
and he trod it to his dying hour.</p>

<p>After inspecting the jails of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, he, in
1775, took the first of those journeys
on the Continent, which had, for their
sole object, the inspection of prisons.
And henceforward, in all his travels,
he is so absorbed in this one object,
that he pays attention to nothing else.
Not the palace, rich with painting and
sculpture; not the beautiful hills and
valleys&mdash;only the prison and the lazaretto
can retain him for a moment.
Once he is tempted to hear some fine
music&mdash;it distracts his attention&mdash;he
foregoes the music. The language of
Burke, in his well-known panegyric,
is true as it is eloquent.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He has visited all Europe&mdash;not to
survey the sumptuousness of palaces or
the stateliness of temples&mdash;not to make
accurate measurements of the remains of
ancient grandeur, nor to form a scale of
the curiosity of modern art&mdash;not to collect
medals or collate manuscripts&mdash;but to
dive into the depths of dungeons, to
plunge into the infection of hospitals, to
survey the mansions of sorrow and pain,
to take the gauge and dimensions of
misery, depression, and contempt, to remember
the forgotten, to attend to the
neglected, to visit the forsaken, and compare
and collate the distresses of all men,
in all countries. His plan is original, and
it is full of genius as it is of humanity.
It was a voyage of discovery, a circumnavigation
of charity. Already the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of his labour is felt more or less in
every country. I hope he will anticipate
his final reward, by seeing all its effects
fully realised in his own."</p></blockquote>

<p>But the boon&mdash;for a great task of
this kind was a veritable boon to such
a spirit as Howard's&mdash;was nearly
missed. Before he went abroad on his
first journey of philanthropy, he ran
the risk of being imprisoned himself,
within the walls of the House of
Commons, as member for the town of
Bedford. The borough had formerly
been under the control of the house of
Russell. Responding to the cry of
"Wilkes and Liberty!" the corporation
had risen against their lord. To
free themselves from his control, they
had boldly created five hundred honorary
freemen, coined, in short, five
hundred votes, which were to be at
their own disposal. The measure
seems to have passed undisputed.
They were, of course, victorious.
Whom they elected, in the first glow of
patriotism, we do not know; but, after
a few years, the corporation rewarded
their own patriotic efforts by selling
the borough to the highest bidder.
Such, at least, was the accusation
brought against them in the town of
Bedford itself, where a strong party
rose which made strenuous efforts to
wrest the election out of their hands.
By this party, Whitbread and Howard
were put in nomination. The candidates
of the corporation were Sir W.
Wake and Mr Sparrow. After a severe
struggle on the hustings, and in
the committee of the House of Commons,
the election was decided in
favour of Whitbread and Wake.
Howard lost his election&mdash;happily, we
think&mdash;by a majority only of four votes.</p>

<p>On his return from the Continent,
he published his first report on the
state of prisons. We had designed to
give some account of this, and the
subsequent publications of Howard,
but our space absolutely forbids.
Perhaps some other opportunity will
occur, when we can review the history
of our prisons, to which the volumes
of Howard form the most valuable
contribution. We must content ourselves
with a few general remarks on
his labours, and with the briefest
possible account of this the great and
eventful period of his life.</p>

<p>To lead our readers over the numerous,
toilsome, and often perilous
journeys which Howard now undertook,
for this national and philanthropic
object of improving our prisons and
houses of correction, would be utterly
impracticable. But, to give them at
once some adequate idea of his incessant
activity, we have thrown into a
note a summary, taken from Dr
Aikin, of what may be considered as
his public labours.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>These long, incessant, and often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
repeated journeys&mdash;were they necessary,
some will be tempted to ask, for
the object he had in view? Surely a
few instances, well reasoned on, would
have been sufficient to put us on the
right track for the reformation of our
prisons. But it should be considered,
in the first place, that Howard was
teaching a people pre-eminently practical
in their intellectual character, a
people who require to be taught by
example and precedent. The most
philosophical reasoning, the most eloquent
diatribe, would not have availed
half so much to stir the public mind,
as, on the one hand, these details
which Howard threw before it, fact
upon fact, unsparingly, repeatedly&mdash;details
of cruelty and injustice perpetrated
or permitted by our own laws;
and, on the other hand, this plain
statement, brought from abroad, that
in Ghent, that in Amsterdam, that
even in Paris, many of the evils which
we suffered to remain as incurable,
<em>were</em> cured, or had never been allowed
to exist. It was much to tell the
citizen of London that in Flanders,
and in Holland, there were prisons
and bridewells that ought to put him
to the blush.</p>

<p>And, in the second place, let it be
considered, that Howard himself was
pre-eminently a practical man. He
neither wrote books of speculation,
nor thought in a speculative manner.
It was from detail to detail that his
mind slowly advanced to principles
and generalisations. These prisons,
they were his books; these repeated
circuits he made through the jails of
Europe, they were his course of reading.
He reperused each blotted page of
human misery till he was satisfied
that he had comprehended all it could
teach. He was no Beccaria to enunciate
a principle from the recesses of
his library, (though it should be mentioned,
in passing, that he had read
Beccaria&mdash;that the man of speculative
talent had stimulated the man of
administrative talent, and the two
were co-operating, all over Europe,
on the same great subject of penal
legislation;) his eye was ever upon
practices, he got wisdom in the concrete,
principle and instance indissolubly
combined: he so learnt, and
he so taught.</p>

<p>Again, in England itself, there was
no system that equally regulated all
the jails of the country; or, to speak
more correctly, there was no uniformity
in the abuses which existed
amongst them. Arrangements were
found in one, no trace of which might
be discovered in another. All were
bad, but the evils in each were different,
or assumed different proportions.
In some, there was no separation between
the debtor and the criminal;
in others, these were properly classified,
but the criminal side might be
more shamefully mismanaged than
usual. In some, there was no attention
paid to the sick; in others, the
infirmary might be the only part of
the jail that was not utterly neglected.
There might be a good supply of
medicine, and no food. In some,
the separation of the two sexes was
decently maintained; in others not.
It was impossible to make any general
statement that would not have
called forth numerous contradictions.
An accusation strictly just with regard
to York, might be repelled with indignation
by Bristol; whilst, on some
other charge, Bristol might be the
culprit, and York put on the show of
injured innocence.</p>

<p>Some prisons were private property;
they were rented to the jailor,
and he was to extract the rent and
his profit, by what extortion he could
practise on his miserable captives.
These were prisons belonging to liberties,
manors, and petty courts, of the
existence of which few people were
aware. In some of these the prisoner
lay forgotten by his creditor&mdash;lay there
to starve, or live on the scanty and
precarious charity of those who gave
a few pence to "the starving debtor."
In many cases the jailor&mdash;for all remuneration
and perquisite&mdash;was allowed
<em>to keep a tap</em>. Of course, whatever
was doled out to the prisoner by
charity, was spent in drunkenness.
The abuses were of all kinds, strange,
and numberless. Howard tracked
them out, one by one&mdash;recorded them&mdash;put
them in his book&mdash;published
them to the world.</p>

<p>Add to all this, that, after some
time, he became invested with the
character of <em>censor</em> of the prisons.
He looked through them to see that,
when a good law <em>had</em> been made, it
was obeyed. There was never a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
commissioner so universally respected.
Men are not so bad but they all admired
his great benevolence, and his
justice equally great. No bribery, no
compliments, and no threats, could
avail anything. In vain the turnkey
suggested to <em>him</em>, that the jail-fever
was raging in the lower wards:
the crafty official had so deterred
many a visiting magistrate, who had
thanked him politely for his warning,
and retired. Howard entered, and
found <em>no</em> jail-fever; but he found filth
and famine, that had been shut up
there for years from the eyes of all
men. No danger deterred him. The
infected cell, where the surgeon himself
would not enter&mdash;from which he
called out the sick man to examine
him&mdash;was the very last he would
have omitted to visit. This character
of public censor he carried with
him abroad, as well as at home. Foreign
potentates courted his good
opinion of their institutions&mdash;consulted
him&mdash;shrank from his reproof&mdash;a
reproof all Europe might hear. The
Grand-duke of Tuscany, the Emperor
of Germany, the Empress of Russia,
were all anxious to see and hear him.
He had no flattery for them; the report
he gave was as faithful as a page
out of his note-book.</p>

<p>As a popular misconception has
prevailed upon the character of Howard,
attributing benevolence to him
as almost a sole motive, so a like popular
misconception has prevailed, as
to the nature and objects of that benevolence.
He is sometimes spoken of
as if to visit the sick and the captive,
and relieve <em>them</em> individually, was the
main object of his charitable journeys,
and his unremitting inquisitions. If,
indeed, he had done nothing more
than seek out those unhappy men,
who, at the bottom of their infected
dens, lay abandoned by all the world,
he would have been entitled to our
admiration, and to all the merits of a
heroic charity. But he did more than
this. He aimed at a permanent improvement
of the condition of the
prisoner. He aimed farther still. His
object was the same which excites so
much attention at the present moment:
by a good system of imprisonment,
both to punish and reform the
criminal. "To make them better
men," is a phrase often in his mouth,
when speaking of prisoners; and he
thought this might be effected by
combining imprisonment with labour,
with perfect abstinence from intoxicating
drinks, and other good regulations.
Those who will read his reports
with attention, will be surprised to
find how often he has anticipated the
conclusions to which a wider experience
has led the reflective men of our
own age. There is a note of his upon
Solitary Confinement which might be
adopted as a summary of those views
which enlightened men, after many
trials of various systems, have rested
in. No false sensibility accompanied
the benevolence of Howard. In some
respects he was a sterner disciplinarian
than would be generally approved
of.</p>

<p>Upon this aspect of his character
there remains only one remark to add:
his mind was never absorbed in the
great objects of a public philanthropy
to an oblivion of his <em>near duties</em> and
his private charities: he was to the
last the just, considerate, benevolent
landlord, quite as much as he was
Howard the philanthropist.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"During his absence in one of his
tours," says Dr Aikin, "a very respectable-looking
elderly gentleman on horseback,
with a servant, stopt at the inn nearest
Mr Howard's house at Cardington, and
entered into conversation with the landlord
concerning him. He observed that
characters often appeared very well at a distance,
which could not bear close inspection;
he had therefore come to Mr Howard's residence
in order to satisfy himself concerning
him. The gentleman then, accompanied
by the innkeeper, went to the
house, and looked through it, with the
offices and gardens, which he found in perfect
order. He next inquired into Mr
Howard's character as a landlord, which
was justly represented; and several neat
houses which he had built for his tenants
were shown him. The gentleman returned
to his inn, declaring himself now
satisfied with the truth of all he had
heard about Howard. This respectable
stranger was no other than Lord Monboddo;
and Mr Howard was much
flattered with the visit, and praised his
lordship's good sense in taking such a
method of coming at the truth, since he
thought it worth his trouble."</p></blockquote>

<p>The traveller who undertook all
these philanthropic journeys was a
man of slight form, thin, and rather
beneath the average height. Every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
feature, and every movement, proclaimed
energy and determination.
"An eye," says Dr Aikin, "lively and
penetrating, strong and prominent features,
quick gait and animated gestures,
gave promise of ardour in forming,
and vivacity in executing his designs."
"Withal there was a bland smile,"
says another of his biographers, "always
ready to play upon his lips." "I
have," continues Aikin, "equally seen
the tear of sensibility start into his
eyes, on recalling some of the distressful
scenes to which he had been witness;
and the spirit of indignation
flash from them, on relating instances
of harshness and oppression." In his
dress and person he was remarkably
neat, and in his ablutions, we are told,
punctilious as a Mussulman;&mdash;far
more so, we suspect. For the rest, he
had reduced his wants to the lowest
possible scale. Water and the simplest
vegetables sufficed. Animal food,
and all vinous and spirituous liquors,
he had utterly discarded. Milk, tea,
butter, and fruit were his luxuries;
and he was equally sparing in the
quantity of food, and indifferent as
to the stated times of taking it.</p>

<p>From the prisoner, and the subject
of prison-discipline, it is well known
that the attention of Howard was
directed to measures for arresting the
plague. It was a grand idea this&mdash;that
he would lead the way to some general
scheme to be adopted throughout
Europe, and the contiguous parts of
Asia, for checking the incursions of,
and perhaps finally exterminating,
the plague. For no object did he
suffer so much, or expose himself to
so great dangers; embarking purposely
in a vessel with a foul bill
of health, and undergoing the perilous
confinement of the lazaretto,
that every practice of the quarantine
might be thoroughly known to him. Nowhere
was his conduct more heroic. It
cannot be said here, however, that his
object was equally well chosen, or that
his labours were attended with any good
result. Whilst it would be difficult to
over-estimate the value of his service
as inspector-general of the prisons of
Europe, we can detect nothing in this
latter scheme but an unfortunate waste
of heroic benevolence. In dealing
with jails and houses of correction, he
was dealing with evils, the nature of
which he, and all men, could well understand;
but, in dealing with the
pestilence, he was utterly in the dark
as to the very nature of the calamity he
was encountering. It is very probable
that, had he realised his utmost
wishes, and built a lazaretto on the
most improved plan, combining every
valuable regulation he had observed
in every lazaretto of Europe, it would
only have proved an additional
nuisance.</p>

<p>This period of his life is more full
of striking incidents than any other,
but we must hurry rapidly over it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The point," says Mr Brown, "at
which he wished to commence his new
investigations was Marseilles; but the extreme
jealousy of the French government
respecting their Levant trade, had long
kept the lazaretto of that port carefully
concealed from the eye of every foreigner;
but, as Mr Howard's object was such as
ought to have awakened neither political
nor commercial jealousy in any one, Lord
Caermarthen, then secretary of state for
foreign affairs, made an application to the
French minister for permission for him to
view this celebrated building. After
waiting some time at the Hague, in expectation
of its arrival, he went to Utrecht
to visit his friend Dr Brown, at whose
house he received a letter from his lordship,
informing him, not only that the request
he preferred had been peremptorily
refused, but that he must not think of
entering France at all, as, if he did, he
would run a risk of being committed to the
Bastille. Howard, however, was not to
be deterred. He started immediately for
Paris. At Paris, "having gone to bed,
according to his usual custom, about ten
o'clock, he was awaked between twelve
and one, by a tremendous knocking at
his room door, which, starting up, in
somewhat of an alarm, he immediately
opened; and, having returned to bed, he
saw the chambermaid enter with a candle
in each hand, followed by a man in a black
coat, with a sword by his side, and his
hands enveloped in an enormous muff.
This singular personage immediately
asked him if his name was not Howard.
Vexed at this interruption, he hastily
answered, 'Yes&mdash;and what of that?' He
was again asked if he had not come to
Paris in the Brussels diligence, in company
with a man in a black wig? To
this question he returned some such
peevish answer, as that he paid no attention
to such trifles; and his visitor immediately
withdrew in silence. Not a
little alarmed at this adventure, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
losing none of his self-possession, and
being unable to compose himself to sleep,
Mr Howard got up; and, having discharged
his bill the night before, took his small
trunk, and, removing from this house, at
the regular hour of starting took his seat
in the diligence, and set off for Lyons."</p></blockquote>

<p>Such is the narrative of Mr Brown.
It has been supposed that this midnight
visitor was an officer of the police, and
that, had Howard remained a few
hours longer at his hotel, he would
have been arrested. But some mystery
still hangs over this adventure.
Howard, in one of his letters, alluding
to it, says that he had since learnt
who his strange visitor was, and adds
that "he had had a narrow escape;"
and his biographer Mr Brown tells
us that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He learned that the man in a black wig
was a spy, sent with him to Paris, <em>by the
French Ambassador at the Hague</em>, and
that he himself would have been arrested
then, (at Paris,) if Mr Le Noir had not
been at Versailles on the day of his arrival;
and, several persons having recently been
arrested on very false or frivolous grounds,
he had left orders for no arrests being
made before his return, which was not
until late in the evening of the next day,
when he was pursued, but not overtaken."</p></blockquote>

<p>If it was this that Howard learnt,
we think his informant must have deceived
him. An air of great improbability
hangs over this story. The
French government is represented as
being so anxious to arrest Howard, if
he should enter France, that it sends a
spy to travel with him from the Hague;
if so, the identity of Howard was
sufficiently known to the police on his
arrival at Paris. Yet we are next
told that an officer visits Howard at
midnight, only to assure himself that
it <em>is</em> Howard;&mdash;pays a visit, in short,
that can have no other effect than to give
the alarm to his intended captive. In
addition to this, we are to suppose that
this person, whom the French government
is so anxious to arrest, pursues
his journey unmolested, and spends
five days at Marseilles, visiting the
very lazaretto to which it was known
he was bound, and the inspection of
which that government was so solicitous
to prevent.</p>

<p>As to the other motives by which
Mr Brown accounts for these hostile
proceedings of the French government,
we can attach no weight to
them whatever. On a previous visit
to Paris, Howard had been extremely
desirous to survey the interior of the
Bastille. Not being able to obtain
permission, he had boldly knocked at
the outer door, and, assuming an air
of official authority, walked in. He
had penetrated to some of the inner
courts before this little <em>ruse</em> was detected.
He was then, of course, conducted
out. He was obliged to
content himself with an account of
the Bastille written in French, and
the publication of which had been
forbidden by the government. He
obtained a copy, and translated it
into English. For this, and for another
cause of offence of a far slighter
character, it is difficult to suppose
that Howard had excited the peculiar
animosity of the French government.</p>

<p>Howard visited the lazaretto of
Marseilles, however, under the full
impression that the police were on the
search for him. From Marseilles he
went to Toulon, and inspected the
arsenal and the condition of the galley-slaves.
To obtain admission into
the arsenal, he dressed himself, says
Mr Brown, "in the height of the
French fashion," Englishmen being
strictly prohibited from viewing it at
all. We are told that this disguise
was easy to him, "as he always had
much the air and appearance of a
foreigner, and spoke the French language
with fluency and correctness."
Mr Dixon, faithful to his system of
caricaturing all things, describes him
as "dressed as an exquisite of the
Faubourg St Honoré!" We presume
that it was the French gentleman of
the period, and not the French dandy,
that Howard imitated.</p>

<p>He next visited the several lazarettos
of Italy&mdash;went to Malta&mdash;to
Smyrna&mdash;to Constantinople, everywhere
making perilous inquisitions
into the plague. At Smyrna he is
"fortunate enough" to meet with a
vessel bound to Venice with a foul bill
of health, and he embarks in it. On
its way, the vessel is attacked by pirates.
"The men," says Mr Brown,
"defended themselves for a considerable
time with much bravery, but were
at length reduced to the alternative of
striking, or being butchered by the
Moors, when, having one very large
cannon on board, they loaded it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
whatever missiles they could lay their
hands upon, <em>and, pointed by Mr Howard
himself</em>, it was discharged amongst
the corsair crew with such effect that
a great number of them were killed,
and the others thought it prudent to
sheer off." Pointed by Mr Howard
himself! We can well understand it.
The intrepid, energetic man, Fellow
too of the Royal Society, would look at
the elevation of the gun, and lend a
helping hand to adjust it.</p>

<p>We throw into a note a parting
specimen of the manner of Mr Dixon.
Not satisfied with the simple and probable
picture which Mr Brown presents
to us, he makes Howard load
the gun as well as point it&mdash;makes
him sole gunner on board; and in
order to improve his <em>tableau</em>, after
having fought half the battle through,
recommences it, that he may discharge
his gun with the more effect.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
Mr Dixon advertises, as his next
forthcoming work, a history of our
prisons. We are sorry that so good a
subject has fallen into such bad hands.
Unless he should greatly improve,
we shall have a book necessarily replete
with much popular and interesting
matter, in not one page of which
will the narrative be strictly trustworthy.</p>

<p>At Venice he is conducted to the
lazaretto, to undergo the quarantine.
He is shut up in a close loathsome
room, the very walls of which are
reeking with foul and pestilential
odours. Surely never was a valuable
life so heroically ventured, for so futile
a purpose. Whilst lying here, smitten
with a low fever, he received&mdash;we
quote from Mr Brown&mdash;"intelligence
from England of two circumstances
which had transpired there,
each of them an occasion of the deepest
affliction to his mind. The first
was the formation of a fund for the
erection of a statue to his honour;
the second the misconduct of his only
son."</p>

<p>We can well believe they were <em>both</em>
afflictions. Those who have entered
into the character of Howard, will feel
at once that the project of doing him
any public honour would be, in his
own language, "a punishment, and
not a reward." It was mingling with
his conduct and motives that very
alloy of vanity, and consideration for
men's opinion, which he was so anxious
to keep them clear from. If a generous
man has done a kind action for
kindness' sake, how it spoils all if
you <em>pay</em> him for it! You lower him
at once. He refuses your payment;
he would deny, if he could, his previous
action; he begs, at all events,
it may be utterly forgotten. To pay
Howard in praise was, to his mind,
as great an incongruity. He shrank
from the debasing coin. He would
have denied his philanthropy: "Say
it is my hobby, if you will," he is
heard at one time to mutter. Dying,
he says to his friend&mdash;"Lay me
quietly in the earth, place a sun-dial
over my grave, and let me be forgotten."
Child of Time&mdash;was it not
enough?</p>

<p>When he had escaped the lazaretto
and returned to England, he wrote a
letter to the gentlemen who had undertaken
to collect subscriptions, requesting
them to lay aside their project.
The money collected was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
part returned, a part was spent in
liberating a certain number of poor
debtors, and the residue was applied
towards erecting, at his death, the
statue of him in St Paul's Cathedral.</p>

<p>His son he was compelled to consign
to the care of a lunatic asylum.
He now published the information he
had obtained, at so much risk, upon
lazarettos, and the mode of performing
quarantine, together with additional
observations upon prisons and
hospitals at home and abroad. Connected
with this publication, an incident
is related, which shows the
extraordinary value Howard had put
on the materials he had collected, and
also the singular perseverance and determination
of the man. We give it
in the words of Mr Brown:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"On his return from his Turkish tour,
one of his boxes was stolen as he was getting
into a hackney-coach in Bishopsgate
Street, from the stage in which he had
travelled from Dover. It contained a
duplicate of his travels, twenty-five
guineas, and a gold watch. The plan of
the lazaretto of Marseilles, of which he
possessed no duplicate, was, happily, <em>in
the other box</em>. Had it not been so, he declared
to his friend Dr Lettsom, that,
notwithstanding the risks he had run in
procuring that document, so important
did he consider it, that he would a second
time have exposed himself to the danger
of a visit to France to supply its place."</p></blockquote>

<p>We believe he would.</p>

<p>This publication completed, and his
son so unhappily disposed of, the
veteran philanthropist quitted his
country again, and for the last time.
It was still against the plague that his
enterprise was directed. He seems
to have thought that successful barricades,
by quarantine and other measures,
might be erected against it.
With the plague, as with the cholera,
it is generally admitted there is some
occult cause which science has not
yet penetrated; but the predisposing,
or rather the co-operating causes, are,
in both cases, dirt and bad diet; and
the quarantine which would attack
<em>these</em> is the only measure which, in
our present state of knowledge, is
worthy of serious consideration. It
was his purpose, this time, to travel
through Russia into Turkey, and
thence, perhaps, to extend his journey
far into the East, to whatever city
this grim enemy of mankind might
have taken possession of.</p>

<p>He had reached as far as Cherson,
on the eastern borders of Russia,
visiting, according to his wont, prisons
and hospitals on his way. Here he
was seized by a fever which proved
mortal, and which he is supposed
to have caught in visiting, with his
usual benevolence, a young lady, to
whom also it proved fatal. He was
buried in the grounds belonging to the
villa of a French gentleman who had
shown him much attention. A small
brick pyramid, instead of the sun-dial
he had suggested, was placed over his
grave. The little pyramid or obelisk
still stands, we are told&mdash;stands alone,
"on a bleak desolate plain." But
Protestant England has a monument
in that little pyramid, which will do
her as much honour as any colony or
empire she has planted or subdued.</p>

<h2>THE GREEN HAND.</h2>

<h3>A "SHORT" YARN.</h3>


<h4>PART VII.</h4>

<p>"Well," continued the commander,
his voice making use of the breeze as
he stood aft of the group, "I could
not have slept more than three or four
hours on a stretch, when I was woke
up by a fellow shoving his lantern in
my face, and saying it wasn't me he
wanted; for which I gave him a hearty
objurgation, and turned over with a
swing of the cot to go to sleep again.
The sailor grumbled something about
the parson being wanted for the captain,
and all at once it flashed on my
mind where we were, with the whole of
last night's ticklish work&mdash;seeing that,
hard rub as it was, it had clean left
me for the time. "Try the aftermost
berth, then," said I, slipping out in
the dark to put on my trousers. The
fact was, on going below to our state-room,
I had found my own cot taken
up by some one in the confusion; and
as every door stood open at night in
that latitude, I e'en made free with
the nearest, which I knew was the
missionary's. In a minute or two I
heard Westwood meet the mate, who
said he thought the captain would
like to see him, and hoped they hadn't
"disturbed the other gentleman."
"Oh no, I daresay not," said Westwood,
rather nervously, guessing, I
daresay, what he was wanted for;
while Finch slipped quietly past to
listen at the state-room door, where
both he and I might hear the "other
gentleman," whoever he was, snoring
pretty plain. When the first officer
shut the door to, however, turned the
key, and put it in his pocket, I nearly
gave vent to a whistle.&mdash;"I see!"
thought I; "but, my fine fellow, it
seemed you never were meant for a
good jailor, anyhow!" He was no
sooner gone than I walked forward
toward the captain's cabin, near the
after-hatchway, anxious enough to
see how the poor man was, since I had
had such a share in bringing him to a
point, one way or another. Westwood
was standing against the light
out of the open door, and I looked in
along with him, at the cot slung high
to the beams like a lump of shadow,
the lamp striking across below it on
all the captain's little affairs&mdash;his
glazed hat and his wet coat, the
names of two or three old books,
even, hanging in shelves against the
bulkhead&mdash;and into the little state-room
off the cabin, where the surgeon
was stooping to mix a draught.
The hard-featured Scotch mate stood
holding the captain's wrist with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
one clumsy flipper, as if trying
to feel his pulse, fumbling about
his own face with the other, and
looking more concerned than I'd
thought possible for him. "Well,
I've slept a&mdash;good deal," said the
captain, in a weak voice, putting up
his hand slowly to rub his eyes, but
seemingly quite composed, and knowing
nothing of what had happened&mdash;which
rid me of the horrid notion I
could scarce help before, that he had
known what he was about. His head
was close shaved, and the look of a
sailor clean gone off his face with the
bluff, honest oak-colour it commonly
had, till you'd have wished him decently
in his bed thousands of miles off, with
women slipping out and in; only the
blood from his arm hanging down on
the sheet, with the sharp point of his
nose and the shape of his knees coming
up off the shadow, kept it all in
one with the wild affair on deck a
few hours gone. "She's on her course,
you say?" added he, listlessly. "Must
be a <em>very</em> light breeze though, Mr
Macleod." "So it is, sir; so it is,
no doubt!" replied the second-mate,
soothing him; "did ye say we'll
<em>pent</em> the ship, sir?" "Ay, before we
go into port, Mr Macleod, to be sure,"
said Captain Williamson, trying to
put a cheerful tone into his voice;
"she's had a good deal of buffeting,
but we musn't let 'em see it, you
know! Didn't you lose a mizen-topmast
somehow, though, Mr Macleod?"
"'Deed ay, sir," said Macleod hastily,
afraid he was getting upon the
scent of what had happened; "the
first officer's watch it was, sir&mdash;will I
tell Mr Finch ye're wanting to speak
to him about it, Captain Williamson?"
and he began to shuffle towards the
door. "Finch? Finch?" said the
sick man, passing his finger over his
eyes again; "what voyage <em>is</em> this,
Mr Macleod?" "Why&mdash;why," said
the Scotchman, starting, and rather
puzzled himself. "Oo, it's just <em>this</em>
voyage, ye know, sir! Mr Finch, ye
mind, sir?" "No, no; don't let him
leave the deck for a moment, Macleod!"
said the captain anxiously:
"harkye, James, I'm afraid I've
trusted overmuch to the young man
all along! I'll tell ye, Mr Macleod,
I don't know whether I was asleep or
not, but I <em>heard</em> him somewhere wishing
he had the command of this ship!
I shouldn't like him to take her off
my hands! Have you seen the Scilly
lights yet, Mr Macleod?" The mate
shook his head; he had contrived to
persuade the poor man we were far
homeward bound. "If you'd only
get the pilot aboard, Mr Macleod,"
the captain went on, "I'd die contented;&mdash;but
mind the charts&mdash;mind
the charts&mdash;I've got the charts to
mind for another sort of voyage myself,
James!" "Hoot, hoot, captain!"
said the Scotchman, "what sets ye
for to talk after that fashion&mdash;you'll
be up an' about decks directly, sir!
What were ye saying about topem'sts
now, sir?" Captain Williamson gave
the second mate a glance that looked
into him, and he held down his head,
for the man evidently believed fully,
as none of us could help doing, that
there was death on the captain's face.
"James, James!" said the captain
slowly, "you've no notion how some
things weigh on the mind at a pass of
this kind! Other things one don't
remember&mdash;but there's one in particular,
almost as it were yesterday&mdash;why,
surely you were with me that
voyage, Mr Macleod! when I let
some o' the passengers take a boat in
a calm, and all&mdash;" Here he stopped,
seemingly overcome. "There was
one young creature amongst 'em," he
went on, "the age of my own girl,
Macleod&mdash;my own little Nan, you
know&mdash;and now&mdash;now I miss <em>her</em>&mdash;and,
and&mdash;" The poor man gave a great
gulp, clutching the mate's arm, and
gazing him in the face. "Wasn't it
a long time ago?" said he, very anxiously;
"if it wasn't, I would go mad!
They were all drowned&mdash;drowned&mdash;I
<em>see</em> that black squall coming down on
the swell <em>now</em>, man, and the brig, and
all of us looking out to the wind'ard!"
"I mind something about it," replied
Macleod stoutly, though he looked
away; "'twas none o' your fault,
though, Captain Williamson&mdash;they
were just <em>fey</em>, sir; and more than
that, if ye mind, sir, they took the
boat again' all orders&mdash;on the sly, I
may say." Westwood was on the
point of starting forward to make
known how the case stood, on the
strength of our finding the paper in
the bottle; when I pressed his arm,
and whispered that it could only make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
things worse, and cheat the sick man
of a notion more likely to do him good
than otherwise. "It's a heavy charge,
Mr Macleod, a heavy charge!" said
he, falling back again; "and one Mr
Brown needn't envy." "Mr <em>Finch</em>,
sir, ye mind," put in the second mate,
setting him right; "but keep up
your heart, sir, for anysake!" "I
feel I'll last over the time o' next
full tide," said the captain solemnly.
"I don't want to know <em>how</em> far we're
off, only if there's any chance at all,
Macleod, you won't spare canvass to
carry her in." The Scotchman rubbed
one of his hard cheek-bones after
the other, and grumbled something or
other in his throat by way of agreement.
The whole thing was melancholy
to see after last night's stir,
with the dim lamp or two twinkling
along the gloom of the steerage, the
dead quietness of the ship, and the
smothered sort of glare under the
captain's cot bringing out the mere
litter on the floor, to the very cockroaches
putting their ugly feelers out
of one of his shoes in a corner: he
shut his eyes, and lay for a minute or
two seemingly asleep, only murmuring
something about a breeze, and
then asking them to shove out the
port, 'twas so close. The second
mate looked to the surgeon, who
signed to him to do it, as if it didn't
much matter by this time; while he
gave him the draught of physic he
was mixing, however.</p>

<p>The Indiaman was beginning to
swing slowly before the first of the
flood, stern off at her anchors; and
whenever the port was opened, 'twas
so still otherwise, that you heard the
tide clearly in the cabin, rippling
along the timbers to the copper upon
her bows&mdash;plash, plash, and lap, lip,
lap, like no other earthly sound that
a man can hear&mdash;and you even began
to note it on something else a good bit
off, though it seemed to be all quite dark
out-board. The captain's eyes opened
by degrees, till we saw them looking
at us out of the shadow of the cot,
and the second mate started as if to
mend his mistake; only 'twas plain
enough, by that time, the captain <em>knew</em>
the sound, half raising himself up and
listening. A few early musquitoes
came in, and, after dancing about to
refresh themselves in the light and
warmth under the cot, began to bite
savagely; every one of us had a distant
horn sounding in his ear, and
each was rubbing it or his nose, except
the sick man; but not one of them
settled on him. As the starboard
port slued gradually opposite to the
nearest shore, a low, deep hum was
carried in over the water, ebbing and
flowing, and full of dim, creeping
noises, like things stirring in their
sleep, as if the little cabin had been an
ear to the ship. At times the tree-frogs
broke out in a loud clicking
chirrup; then, between the fits of it,
when all seemed still again for a moment
or two, you heard a low, half-smothered,
small sound, deeper down,
as it were, fill up the break with its
throbbing and trill-trilling, as if just
<em>one</em> land-cricket or a grasshopper did
it, till it came out as clear as though
it were a child's rattle close by, and
all of a sudden stopped; when back
floated the huge whispering hum
again, with a damp smell of leaves
on a cold breath of the land air, that
died away as quickly as it reached us.
The bewilderment on Captain Williamson's
white face for that minute's
time was cruel to witness, and Macleod
would certainly have closed the
port, but for the captain's seizing his
arm again, with a wild, questioning
sort of a look into the second mate's
eyes. "Oh, good God!" faltered out
the captain, "it's&mdash;it's <em>land</em>!&mdash;where&mdash;where?&mdash;"
"For goodsake, sir,"
said Macleod, "don't ask me the
now&mdash;take a bit sleep, sir." We
could hear one another breathing,
when ting-tang went four bells on
deck. You heard it going across to
the shore, as it were; and a few moments
after, out of the humming far
and wide along the land, back came
the sound of another bell, toll upon
toll, like some clock striking the hour
a long way off. Then a third one followed
on it, from a different direction,
ringing clearer in the air; while the
murmur and the rush seemed to swell
up the more all round, and the
plashing of the tide made the ship
heave at her anchors. The mate shivered,
Westwood and I started, but
some extraordinary notion or other
gleamed over the captain's face as he
sat up. He was quite in his senses,
too, apparently, though it seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
be neither more nor less than sheer
joy that overcame him, for he let out
a long breath, and his eyes were glistening
as if the tears stood in them.
"James&mdash;James Macleod!" said he
quickly, with a husky voice, "you
oughtn't to've deceived one you've
sailed so long with; but you meant
me a good surprise, and 'twas kindly
done of you! I know the very run
o' the clocks off Greenwich Reach,
man; d'ye think one could mistake
the sound of Lon'on town, fidgeting
when it wakes, either?&mdash;we're&mdash;we're
<em>home</em> already!" And he fell back in
the cot, with the drops running down
his cheeks, smiling happily all the
time at Macleod in a way that went
to one's heart; while the Scotchman
stared helplessly to the surgeon, who
slipped to the port and closed it. "I
know by your way, James," continued
the poor man, "you wanted to send
up to Virginia Row for 'em <em>all</em>; but
don't send for an hour yet; better go
up yourself and break it to 'em&mdash;<em>break</em>
it to 'em, be sure of that, James; I
shouldn't wonder but I pulled up,
after all. Ay&mdash;that first one we heard
was Greenwich Hospital&mdash;t'other in
Dickson's brewery or Redriff&mdash;"
Here his eyelids began to drop, owing
to the sleeping-draught he had got,
when suddenly they opened wide
again. "Ha!" said he, listening,
and putting up a finger, "but I haven't
heard St Paul's strike six yet; it's
seldom so long after; ought to be
heard from here of a morning; let's&mdash;"
By little and little, however, the sick
man's eyes closed, and you heard him
murmuring, as his finger sank down,
"Macleod, say&mdash;to her&mdash;say&mdash;luff,
luff, my lad, keep her her course&mdash;,"
till his shrunk face was as quiet on
the pillow as if he'd been really at
home the first night after a voyage.</p>

<p>"Oh man, doctor!" said the second
mate, heaving a breath, "isn't terrible!
Good forgive me for a lee to a
dying man! Take an old seaman's
word for it, Doctor Small, yon clock
ashore was no mortal soond, sir; ye
may keep your drogues for them
they'll do good to. 'Twas neither
more or less than the captain's <em>dregy</em>!"
"Phoo!" answered the Scotch surgeon,
who was one of your sceptical
chaps, as I heard say, "some other
vessels here, of course, that's all."
The sailor gave him only a smile of
pity for not being able to distinguish
the sound of a ship's bell. "There
can't be a town hereabout, Collins?"
whispered Westwood. "A town,&mdash;no!"
said I, "it's the best wilderness
sign you can have&mdash;the African
bell-bird!"<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> "Ah, ah!" said the
surgeon, laughing, "there now, Macleod,&mdash;of
course it can be explained
naturally, like other things." The
second mate gave me a doubtful
scowl; but seeing Westwood, whom
he had always seemed to think rather
in the way before, his eye softened.</p>

<p>"You'll be wanting to see the captain
as soon as he wakes up, sir," said
he. "I'm terrified to face him&mdash;but
if ye'd juist slip in when he comes to
himself, sir, I'm thinking, reverend
sir, ye might wile him off yon terrible
notion o' his." Westwood shook his
head seriously, not knowing what to say.
"Ay, ay, sir," continued Macleod, as
he half closed the door, "no doubt a
man ought to be upon better things;
but it's hard for him, when he's got a
wife and weans six thousand miles
away, and wants them alongside in a
couple of hours&mdash;uncommon hard, sir!
She's a douce, careful body, too,
Mistress Williamson, like the captain's
self; and I heard her fleech sore with
the captain before we sailed, for to
bide quietly ashore this time, for good.
Poor woman! if she didn't e'en go
the length o' partin' in anger the last
morning, wae's me! till the very moment
when (he telt me himself, sir,)
she out with her arms round his neck,
crying like to choke! An' all to&mdash;but if
the captain had a fault, 'twas the love
o'&mdash;good forgive me, though, when it
was but studying his faim'ly, Mr
Thomas! If it was only an auld tarry
deevil like me, now, with neither kith
or kin!" "Except cousins, Mr Macleod,"
said the surgeon, as he wiped
his lancet on his coat-tail&mdash;"plenty of
them in the High&mdash;" But he caught
Westwood's eye, and was ashamed to
finish his cursed heartless joke, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the rough second mate was too full of
his feeling to hear it: when Westwood
said something about our all thinking
too little of these things before-hand,
but how the captain was plainly a
man that had done his duty carefully,
which no doubt would ease his mind.
The mate looked up, and eyed him
sideways for a moment: "Eh? what?"
said he, bluntly; "it's not so little I
mind o' what I used to hear at the
kirk langsyne, as not to know that's
not the right doctrine. D'ye think, sir,
<em>that's</em> what'll put him over, when he
finds out this is not Greenwich Reach?
There's the Methody minister with
the glasses, though!" he broke out,
when again a look of despair came
over his broad hard-favoured countenance.
"They're always upon
works, too, I've heard!" said he,
turning and murmuring to himself;
"oh, if I could but hoist out a bit
screed o' the truth, myself, to comfort
the poor man with! Lord, how
didn't I think of the Shorter Carritch&mdash;let's
see how't went&mdash;'What is
the chief end of'&mdash;no, it's 'What is
faith in&mdash;faith in the only rule to direct
us&mdash;no, no.&mdash;Baptism is a sacrament&mdash;where&mdash;whereby"&mdash;and
he was still
overhauling some old catechism in
this fashion, twisting himself all the
time as if he were twisting a stiff rope
the wrong way, with a look of misery
none of us could have had the heart
to laugh at, when a middy's voice
came squeaking down the dark after-hatchway.
"Mr Macleod, sir, the
chief officer wants you on deck."
Westwood slipped quietly off, and the
young surgeon was beginning to talk
easily, to rid his mind of something,
perhaps; till I asked if there wasn't
any chance. "Oh, the captain, you
mean?" said he, "don't think there
is&mdash;he's a bad subject! If we were
out at sea now, Mr Collins, the <em>calenture</em>
would make him think the waves
all grass, or something as green as&mdash;as
the cawdets used to call&mdash;" I
looked at the fellow sternly, and he
changed his key, though with a surprised
air. "You're blessed early
up, though, you two!" said he. "I
suppose that cursed squall kept you
idlers awake; but how they managed
without the first mate I can't think.
Clever fellow, Finch! but wasn't it a
curious trick of the poor skipper to
box him up below here? I fancy he'd
a guess we would all soon be under
the mate's command! It's a queer
thing the brain, isn't it, Mr Collins?
For exaumple, now, there's the captain
it makes think something or other
a clock near London, with everything
accordingly! Macleod fancies it a
soopernatural knell, and twaddles
about some Calvinist stuff he learnt
at school. Then you and me, you
know, imaugines it's a bird&mdash;now
whuch is it after all? <em>Nothing</em>&mdash;maybe,
eh?" The fellow capped all with a
sneer, as much as to say I was a fool,
which I had stood from him several
times before; though now I could have
kicked him, more for his heartless way
than aught else. "I'll tell you, Mr
Small," said I, "what I think <em>you</em>&mdash;you're
neither more nor less than a&mdash;"
but I turned on my heel. "I'm off,
however," said he, "to turn in again."</p>

<p>Through the half-closed door one
could see the sick man's face sleeping
so quiet in the shadow from the lamp,
you heard not a breath. I looked up
the after-hatchway. It seemed still
quite dark; and a patch of the deep
dark-blue sky showed high over the
square opening, with two or three
keen sparks of stars, green ones and
blue ones&mdash;you'd have thought the
ladder, short as it was, went up to
somewhere clean above the world.
But the moment I got on deck, I saw
it was really lighter&mdash;the heavy fog
creeping slowly astern of the ship on
both hands; the white mist rolling
faster over it before the sea-breeze
against her bows, which had swung
seaward by this time from the tide,
that rushed like a mill-stream upon
both her tight cables; while the
muddy river-water, bubbling, eddying,
and frothing away past, spread
far up in the middle, into the dusk
astern. <em>Such</em> a jabbering, croaking,
hissing, shrieking, and yelling, too, as
burst into one's ears out of the dark,
as if whole legions of monkeys, bull-frogs,
parrots, parroqueets, and what
not, were coming together full upon
us from both sides, one band nearer
than the other; till the heavy boom of
the surf round the point, and the roar
of the tide coming in over the shallows
about the river-mouth, pretty
well drowned it. The sudden change
was a good relief, Babel though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
seemed, after the closeness below,
with what had been going on; and I
looked ahead towards the sea, which
lay away out off our larboard bow,
round the headland, and over the opposite
point; a cold, watery streak of
light showing it from where the
breakers rose plunging and scattering
along the sandy bar, to the steady
gray line of horizon, clipped by one of
the two brown chops we had got into.
It looked dreary enough as yet, the
mouth of it being wider than I'd fancied
it from seaward at night; though
even with full water over the long
spit of sand in the middle, there was
no draught at all for the Indiaman
except by the channel betwixt it and
the bold point on our right; and
pretty narrow it appeared from our
present berth, heaving as it did with
the green swell that set in, while
meantime the mist scudding across
the face of the headland let us see but
the hard lump of bare black rock underneath.</p>

<p>In less time than I've taken to
speak, however, the full space of sky
aloft was turning clear, the sea far
away suddenly shone out blue, with
the surges tipped white; you saw a
sparkling star high over it sink slowly
in, and the fog spread off the water
near us, till here and there you caught
the muffled-up shape of a big tree
or two looming through, not half-a-mile
off our starboard quarter; the
mist creeping over the headland till
the sharp peak of it stood out against
its shadow on the shoulder of a hill
beyond, and old Bob Martin's single
clump of cocoas on the rise, waving
in landward from the brisk sea-breeze.
One passenger after another came
peeping sleepily out of the companion-hatch,
at the men clearing away the
wreck of the spars, and swabbing the
quarter-deck down; but scarce had
Smith, one of the young writers,
reached the poop, when he gave a
shout that covered both poop-ladders
in no time, with people scrambling
over each other to get up. Next
minute you'd have fancied them a
knot of flamingoes with their wings out,
as the bright red daybreak brought
out the edge of the woods far astern,
through a hazy lane in the purple mist,
topped so with stray cocoa-nut trees
and cabbage-palms, dabbled like
brushes in the colour, that they scarce
knew them to be woods at all, and
not a whole lot of wild savages fresh
from other business of the kind, coming
down with all sorts of queer tools
upon us; more especially when one
heard such a chorus of unaccountable
cries, whistling, and screaming, as
seemed to struggle with the sound of
the sea ahead of us, and the plash
alongside. The huge round sun struck
hot crimson along the far turn of the
reach, with all manner of twisted
blots upon him, as it were, and the
very grass and long reeds seemingly
rustling into his face, so one didn't for
the moment know <em>him</em> either; while
the muddy chocolate-coloured eddies,
sweeping and closing beyond the ship's
rudder, glittered and frothed up like
blood; and every here and there,
along the streak of light, the head of
a log or a long branch came dipping
up terribly plain no wonder the old
Seringapatam had apparently turned
tail to it all, ready to bolt if she could.
Almost as soon as you took your
hands off your eyes, though, and could
see without a red ball or two before
them,&mdash;<em>there</em> was the nearest shore
growing out toward our starboard
bulwark all along, crowded with
wet green woods, up into steaming
high ground&mdash;all to eastward a dazzle
of light, with two or three faint
mountain-peaks shooting up far off in
it, and a woody blue hill or so between;
while here and there a broad bright
hazy spoke off the sun came cutting
down into the forest, that brought out a
patch full of long big leaves, ten times
greener than the rest, and let you look
off the deck into the heart of it amongst
the stems over the bank. The jabber
in the woods had passed off all at once
with the dusk, the water deepening
over the bar, and the tide running
slower, so that every one's confused
face turned breathless with delight as
it grew stiller and stiller. The whole
breadth of the river shone out by this
time, full and smooth, to the opposite
shore three times as far away, where
the wood and bulrushes seemed to
grow out of the water; a long thick
range of low, muddy-looking mangroves,
with a cover of dark-green,
rounding from the farthest point one
saw, down to some sandy hummocks
near the mouth, and a ridge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
same, drifted up by the wind off the
beach. Beyond that side there was
nothing, apparently, but a rolling
sweep of long coarse grass, with a few
straggling cocoa-nut trees and baobabs,
like big swollen logs on end, and
taken to sprouting at top: a dun-coloured
heave of land in the distance,
too, that came out, as it got hotter,
in a long desert-like, red brick-dust
sort of a glare. The sole living things
to be seen as yet, were some small
birds rising up out of the long grass,
and the turkey-buzzards sailing high
over all across, as if on the look-out.</p>

<p>The air was so cool and clear, however,
from the tornado overnight&mdash;not
a cloud in the sky, and the strange
scent of the land reaching us as the
dew rose off it&mdash;you could see far and
wide, with a delicious feeling of it all,
that kept every one standing fixed on
the spot where he first gained the
deck, even the men looking over their
shoulders with the ropes in their fists,
and the fresh morning breeze lifting
one's hair. Surprised as the passengers
were, nobody spoke a word,
except the three or four children
shouting, dancing, and pointing together;
without being noticed, till all
at once the whole poopful burst into
one confusion of questions and exclamations,
running hither and thither,
shaking hands and jostling each
other like distracted people. I had
a spyglass at my eye, making out the
other shore, when, turning round in
the middle of it, the first thing I saw
was Violet Hyde's face, as she stood
with one little foot on the stair-head
behind me, holding the rail with one
hand, her eyes sparkling and her
parted lips murmuring like one in a
dream. "Oh, Mr Collins!" exclaimed
she, breathless; "what is this? Where
are we&mdash;is it fairyland? A <em>river</em>!"
"Yes, in Africa," I said; "but whether
it's the Bembarooghe or the&mdash;"
"That fearful, fearful evening!" continued
she, shuddering: "I saw the
frightful sky, and heard the storm&mdash;and
now!&mdash;<em>Were</em> we not in some very
great danger, sir?" "Yes, ma'am,
we were," replied I, as stiffly as I
could; "but, happily, its over now,"
and I gave my cap a lift to move off,
uneasy as I was every moment, lest Sir
Charles should catch me speaking again
to his daughter. However, Miss Hyde
was gazing eagerly at the land, and I
had to wait. "What lovely, lovely
green!" she half whispered: "oh, if
one could only tread upon!&mdash;so unEnglish
those strange tall trees look!
are they not cocoa-trees and&mdash;and&mdash;"
Suddenly her voice faltered, and she
turned round with her bright blue
eyes swimming in tears&mdash;"How&mdash;how
thankful we should be that we
are not&mdash;like our poor, poor friends,
who were lost!" exclaimed she. I
thought of the poor captain below in
his cot, but next moment I was explaining,
to her sheer amazement,
how the real truth of the matter
stood, though, if possible, it seemed
to horrify her still more. "I can't
think what they may be," I rapped
out; "but if I had the command of
this ship, I'd up anchor this very
hour, and go out&mdash;at least as soon as
the tide ebbed; but, at any rate, at
the Cape I mean to get hold of some
schooner or other, and if it were to
China, why, I'll cruise after 'em till
I&mdash;" "Then you think&mdash;" began she,
and an arch, inquisitive sort of look
danced in both her eyes as she turned
away to watch the shore again, saying slowly,
"You <em>are</em> a&mdash;a naval gentleman,
then, Mr West&mdash;Mr Collins?" I
tried to stammer out something by
way of an explanation, but it wouldn't
do, and I said, "At any rate, I'm no
better, by this time, than an idler
aboard <em>here</em>, ma'am!"</p>

<p>All at once I caught a side-look
from her eyes, that wasn't meant for
me, as she glanced over the poop-netting.
Half provoking and half
sweet it was, though, and it made my
brain somehow or other seem to spin
round, till a little after, before I well
knew what I was about, I was holding
the long spy glass for her to see the
bank of the river,&mdash;her warm breath
coming on my ear as I stooped before
her, near enough to have kissed the
muslin on her shoulder, while her
rosy mouth changed with every new
spot that the glass brought near; and
she had to hold one taper fore-finger
on the other eye-lid to keep it shut,
so that I could dwell on her face as if
she'd been asleep. "There, there!"
exclaimed she, "are actually flowers&mdash;with
such immense leaves! And
now&mdash;an enormous tree, with roots
hanging from the branches, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
stems growing up into them. Why,
yes!&mdash;is not that a banian-tree,
Mr&mdash;," and she looked away at <em>me</em>,
when of course the tree was vanished,
and instead of that, the rather undeniable
expression of a fellow in love,
two or three inches off, bent fair upon
her. Violet Hyde coloured a little,
and looked in again. "And&mdash;I
think&mdash;" continued she, "I see&mdash;oh,
two such beautiful creatures&mdash;deer, I
think&mdash;coming out to drink from the
river!" All this time, the ecstacies
of the rest kept up the noise and confusion:
the young lady's maid was
gaping open-mouthed at the shore,
not even noticing her young mistress's
straw bonnet fall off, and I had just
picked it up with one hand, to put it
quietly over that matchless nut-brown
hair of hers, shining suddenly in the
sun like silk, when the Judge's voice
sang out sharp from the other stair,
"Violet, child, you'll have a sun-stroke.
Kitmagar, you scoundrel,
<i lang="jv" xml:lang="jv">beebee sahib punkah lao, sirrah</i>!" I
held on to the telescope like grim
death, while that eternal punkah was
hoisted over us both, the Judge eyeing
me somewhat coolly for the first moment.
"Well, well, Mr Westwood,"
said he, however, "you've got rid of
that proud freak of yours;&mdash;such behaviour
as yours yesterday, I assure
you, I shouldn't have endured from
any one else, young man! But, my
dear boy," added he, suddenly, "from
what I can gather, indeed saw myself
last night, I am convinced we owe you
a very great deal&mdash;even, I suspect,
the safety of the entire vessel!" Miss
Hyde had left off using the glass, and,
as I stood up, she gave me a quick
glance of amazement. "Mere chance,
sir," I stammered. "Why," said Sir
Charles, "I saw you at the steerage in
the middle of the hurricane, when I
believe the actual officers of the ship
had left it in dismay. I tell you
what, Mr Westwood, you're a bold
fellow; and your uncle and I must see
in India if we can't reward you in
some way, my dear boy!" All this
fondling style of thing, and for little
more than a piece of luck, would have
disgusted me, if I hadn't been more
taken up with watching the side of
Violet Hyde's face, as she listened for
sounds in the woods ashore. "Strange
wasn't it, Violet, my dear," continued
he to his daughter, that my friend
the Councillor's nephew should have
gone out in the same Indiaman, so
fortunately&mdash;though of course, after
all, it <em>was</em> the first this season."
"Ah!" said she, starting, "I beg
pardon, papa,&mdash;what did you&mdash;weren't
you talking of the river?" "Don't
you hear, child," said the Judge, "I
said it was a curious coincidence, Mr
Westwood's going in this vessel."
"Oh yes, indeed!" answered she, and
couldn't help looking down a little confounded.
But the lady's-maid was putting
on her tiny slipper, which had come
off, while her father mentioned that
of course I'd had practical reasons for
not owning my profession hitherto;&mdash;meaning,
I suppose, that I didn't
speak for fear of having to work, like
the monkeys&mdash;though the sharp old
lawyer must have had a better guess
by this time, and queer enough it must
have been to see her face, listening to
him as he explained it all. I stood
biting my lips, meanwhile&mdash;two or
three times on the point of telling him
it was all nonsense about my being a
nephew of any hanged old nabob
whatever; when Sir Charles said carelessly
he should leave the Seringapatam,
if possible, at the Cape of Good
Hope, as he couldn't trust safely to the
present officers.</p>

<p>Just then up got the merry chant
of the men running round with the
capstan-bars, to get up anchor; the
chief officer wishing, as it was found,
to carry her farther into the river with
the breeze&mdash;for the sake of filling our
water-casks the easier, according to
him, but more likely out of sheer spite
at what had been done without him.
What with eagerness in the cuddy to
get on shore and see the woods, the
breakfast below was a rare scene, no
one minding what he did, even to
rushing slap into a couple of ladies'
berth for his boots, or laying a couple
of loaded Joe Mantons into somebody's
bed, swallowing biscuit and
butter on the way.</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard the splash of
paddles in the water, with a hail in
some foreign tongue or other, and
hurried on deck in a body; where we
found the ship tiding it slowly up, under
jibs and foretopsail, and beginning
to open a longer reach where the river
seemed to narrow in. A black-eyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
black-bearded fellow, with a tallowy,
yellow, sweaty sort of complexion, in a
dirty jacket, drawers, and short boots,
and an immense grass hat, shouting
Portuguese louder and louder into the
first-mate's ear, till he actually put
both hands together and roared
through them,&mdash;pointing to himself
now and then, as if surprised he
wasn't known. All at once, evidently
quite disgusted, he turned and looked
over the side, saying something to
one of the ugliest and most ill-looking
mulattoes I ever saw, who sat in the
stern of a long rough canoe, hollowed
out of some tree, with two naked
black rowers, less of the real nigger
than himself, as they leant grinning
up at the bulwarks with their sharp
teeth, that appeared as if they'd been
filed to a point. The mulatto gloomed,
but he gave no answer, and as one of
the cadets and I knew a little Portuguese,
we managed together to get
something out of the fellow on deck;
though at noticing me for the first
time that morning, I saw Finch turn
red with surprise. We understood
the man to ask if we wanted nothing
particular in the river, the meaning of
which I saw better on bethinking me
of the fire along the bush inside the
headland, that had let me see the marks
of it&mdash;no doubt a signal to some
craft they had taken us for. However,
so soon as he heard we needed no
more than water and spars, after musing
a minute, and speaking again to
Rodriguez, as he called the mulatto,
he said he would pilot us to a convenient
berth himself, for two or three
dollars; notwithstanding his title was,
as he said, Don José Jeronimo Santa
somebody, commandant of the Portuguese
fort something else. The river,
we found, was the Nouries or the Cuanené,
where they had a settlement
called Caconda, a good way up; a
remarkably bad country, he gave us
to know, and not worth staying in,
from the number of flies, and the elephants
having got into a cursed way
of burying their tusks,&mdash;except, he
hinted, for the plenty of blacks, all
anxious to be sold and to see foreign
countries; but the trade was nothing
yet, absolutely nothing, said he,
blowing his nose without a pocket
handkerchief, and suiting the act to
the word, as he mentioned his notion
of throwing it up and going farther
north-west. By this time we had
stood over to the lowest shore, till
you could see the thick coffee-coloured
mud in among the roots and suckers
of the dark-green mangroves, with
their red pods bursting under their
rank-looking leaves,&mdash;and over them,
through the tall coarse guinea-grass,
to the knots of feathery cocoas behind,
swarming with insects: when he gave
the sign to go about, one of his
blacks heaving a lead, and grunting
out the depth of water, as the ship
made a long stretch across towards
the woody side again, and Don José
all the time taking it as easy as
if the quarter-deck were his own,
while he asked for a cigar and lighted
it. Joke though he did, yet I couldn't
like the fellow at all; however, as
soon as she got pretty near the shore,
about a quarter of a mile from
the mouth of what seemed a wide
creek, glittering up between a high
fringe of cane and bamboo clumps, he
had the sails clued up, a single anchor
let go in four or five fathoms, and our
Portuguese friend got his money and
bundled over the side, pulling quietly
ashore.</p>

<p>The tide by this time was quite
still, and the breeze sank almost at
once, as we were shut in from the
sea; when we were surprised to see
the striped Portuguese flag rise off a
tall bamboo stick, among the bushes
on the open shore, nearly abreast of
us; where a low, muddy-like wall was
to be made out, with something of a
thatched roof or two, and a sort of rude
wooden jetty running before it into the
water. Shortly after, Don José came
paddling out again, and got on board,
this time with an old cocked hat on,
excusing himself for not having fired
a gun&mdash;which was to save us expense,
he remarked, being particular friends&mdash;seeing
that he'd got to demand
twelve dollars of harbour dues and
duties, whereas, if he saluted, he must
have charged fourteen. The cool
impudence of this brought the chief
officer from the capstan; but the
steady face of the fellow, and the
glance he took round the deck when
the cadet told him he'd better be off
at once, made me think he had something
or other to back him. Mr
Finch, as usual, fumed up into a passion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
and told the men to fling him
over into his canoe, which they accordingly
did, without the least nicety
about it; the Portuguese next minute
picking himself up, and standing
straight, with the look of a perfect
devil, as he shook his fist at the
whole ship, while the canoe slid off to
the shore.</p>

<p>Budge even so much as a single
fathom, at present, we could not;
and most of us were too much in the
spirit of fun and venture to care a fig
for having made an enemy of Don
José-So-on, as the cadet called him;
indeed, it seemed rather to set a finer
point on people's admiration of the
green jungly-looking shore next to us,
with its big aloes and agaves growing
before the bush, and all sorts of
cocoas, palms, monkey-bread, and
tall white-flaked cotton-trees, rising in
every way out from over the rest.
For my part, I thought more of the
Portuguese's <em>interest</em>, after all, than
his hatred&mdash;which proved correct, by
his soon sending out a sulky message
by the mulatto, offering to sell us
fowls and a bullock, at no ordinary
price. However, all hands from the
cabin were mad already to get ashore
somewhere, and the cadets bristling
with fowling-pieces and rifles, each
singing out that he was ready to supply
the whole ship with fresh meat;
so the mulatto had to sheer off, with
a boat nearly lowered over his head.
From where we lay at the time, what
with the large creek off one bow, and
the broad river ahead of us, spreading
brimful along to the light, the
water had the look of a huge lake,
fringed in by a confused hazy bluish
outline steeping in the heat, where
the distance clipped behind the lumps
of keen verdure, showering over a
dark mangrove-covered point. Before
the two large quarter-boats could
be got ready for the ladies and the
rest of us, in fact, we heard the gig
full of writers and cadets beginning
to pop away at everything they saw
alive, out of sight from the ship; till
at last we were afloat, too, pulling
slowly into the middle of the stream,
and the men eyeing us lazily as they
turned-to about the rigging, to send
up new spars in place of those lost.
The old Indiaman's big bows stood
looming up broad astern of us on the
sluggish eddies round her cable, with
her tall steady fore-spars and furled
yards rising white against the low
line of marshy shore in the distance,
and wavering in her shadow below,
till the thick green branches of the
next point shut her out, and the glare
off the face of the creek shot level
over all of us in the two cutters, wild
with every kind of feeling that India
passengers could have after two
months' voyage.</p>

<p>For my own part, I should have
had rather a suspicion how absurd it
was to go a pleasuring in an African
river we knew nothing about, especially
when I saw that a day or two
so long after the rains might suck it
up, during ebb, into a pretty narrow
mid-channel: all I thought of was,
however, that I was steering the boat
with Violet Hyde in it, the kitmagar
holding his gaudy punkah over her
before me, while the Judge, with his
gun in his hands, was looking out as
eagerly, for the time, as the four griffins
were pulling furiously, in spite of
the heat that made the sweat run into
their eyes.</p>

<p>The other party were soon off ahead
of us up the main river, under care of
the Scotch surgeon, laughing, talking,
and holloing in chase of the cadets
who had first left. However, Sir
Charles thought there was more
likelihood of game along the creek,
and the ladies fancied it something
new, so I steered right into it; the fat
midshipman, Simm, watching me critically
as I handled the yokelines which
he had given up to me in a patronising
way, and the sailor in the bow
regarding the exertions of the griffins
with a knowingly serious expression,
while he dabbled his flipper at ease in
the water. As the tide steadied, this
said creek proved to be a smaller
river, apparently from the hilly country
I had noticed beyond the woods;
by the clearness of its current, that
showed the pale yellow reflection of
the close bamboo-brake on one side,
deep down into the light&mdash;the huge
sharp green notched aloe-leaves and
fern shoving here and there out of it&mdash;the
close, rank, stifling smell of rotten
weeds and funguses giving place to
the strange wild scent of the flowers,
trailing and twisting in thick snaky
coils close up the stems on our opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
hand, and across from branch to
branch, with showers of crimson and
pink blossoms and white stars; till,
eager as the ladies were to put foot
on land, 'twas no use looking as yet
for a spot of room, let alone going
farther in. The cadets were not long
in being blown, either; when the midshipman,
the bowman, and I had to
relieve them. However, <em>then</em> I could
look straight toward Violet Hyde's
face, the shade of the scarlet punkah
hanging over it, and her soft little
straight nose and forehead catching a
flickering burst from the leaves as we
sheered at times under cover of the
bank; while her eyelids, dropping from
the glare, gave her bright eyes a half-sleepy
sort of violet look, and it was
only her lips that let you see how
excited she felt. The griffin who had
the tiller steering with the judgment
of a tailor's 'prentice on a picnic
to Twickenham, we came two or three
times crash into the twigs of some
half-sunk tree; then a blue bird like
a heron would rise direct ahead of
us, with its tall wet spindle legs
and spurs glistening like steel behind
it into the light, and a young snake
in its sharp bill; or a gray crane
rustled out of the cane from overhead,
its long wings creaking in the air out
of our sight. Suddenly you heard a
long chirruping croak from a tree-frog,
and the ground ones gave full chorus
from farther in, whining and cackling,
and peep-peep-peeping in one complete
rush that died as suddenly away
again, like thousands of young turkeys&mdash;then
out in the midst of the quiet
would come a loud clear wheetle-wheetling
note from some curious
fowl in an opening, with another of
the same to match, dimmer amongst
the thick of the bush. However
everything of the kind seemed to sink
down with the heat at noon, the very
buzz of flies round every dark feather
of the cocoas, and the musquito hum
along the bank, getting fainter; till
one <em>heard</em> the heat, as it were, creeping
and thrilling down through the
woods, with the green light that
steeped into both edges of the long
creek; every reed, cane, leaf, and
twig, seemingly, at last giving it back
again with a whispering, hushing
crackle, and the broad fans of the
palms tingling in it with rays from
them, as they trembled before you
in the glare, back into the high bundles
of knotted and jointed bamboo,
with their spiky-tufted crowns.</p>

<p>"Can you not almost <em>feel</em> the forest
grow!" exclaimed Miss Hyde; while
the boat floated quietly to one side, and
her charming young face shining out
from the punkah, before Master Gopaul's
deucedly ugly one, coolly staring
past his snub nose, made one think of
a white English rose and a black puff-ball
growing together under a toadstool;
plenty of which, as red as
soldiers' coats, and as big as targets,
looked here and there out of the bank.
It put new spirit into me to see her,
but still we could do little more than
shove across from one side to the
other&mdash;till something all at once
roused us up in the shape of a long
scaly-like log, seemingly lying along
in the sun, which tumbled off the edge
with a loud splash, and two of the
young fellows let drive from their
fowling-pieces, just after the alligator
had sunk to the bottom. Rather
uncomfortable it was to come sheering
right over him next moment, and
catch a glimpse of his round red eyes
and his yellow throat, as the mud
and weeds rose over him. The other
ladies shrieked, but Violet Hyde only
caught hold of her father's arm and
started back; though her blue eye
and the clear cut of her pretty
nostril opened out, too, for the moment
her lips closed. Five minutes
after, when a couple of large guinea-fowl
sprang up, Sir Charles proved
himself a better shot than the cadets,
by dropping one of them over the
water ahead of us, which was laid
hold of by the reefer of the Indiaman,
and stowed away fluttering into the
stern-locker&mdash;Simm observing coolly
that it was a scavengering carrion-sort
of bird, but perhaps one of his
messmates might like to take it home
stuffed to his sister. The Judge merely
smiled and patted the mid on the
shoulder, remarking in great good-humour
that he, Simm, would make a
good attorney; and on we held,
soaking to our shirts and panting,
until the bowman hooked down the
stem of a young plantain, with a huge
bunch of full ripe yellow bananas
under the long flapping leaves at its
head, right into the midst of us, out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
of a whole clump of them, where the
smooth face of the cove showed you
their scarlet clusters of flowers and
green round pods hanging over it,
hidden as they were from above.
Every man of us made a clutch, and
the stem almost lifted Simm out of
the boat with it, as it sprang back
into the brake, rousing out a shower
of gaudy-coloured butterflies, and a
cloud of musquitoes, and making
the paroquets scream inside; while
the cadets' mouths were so full they
couldn't speak, the reefer making a
gulp with the juice seeming to come
out at his eyes, the sailor spitting out
his quid and stuffing in a banana, and
the ladies hoping they were safe to
eat; as I peeled the soft yellow rind
off, and handed one to Violet Hyde,
which she tasted at once. But if ever
one enters into the heart of things in
the tropics, I'd say 'tis when that
same delicious taste melts through and
through and all over you, after chewing
salt junk for a space. I remember
one foremast-man, who was always so
drunk ashore he used to remember
nothing in India but "<em>scoffing</em><a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> one
bloody benanny," as he called it;
"but hows'ever, Jack," he'd say,
"'twas blessed good, ye know, and I'm
on the look-out for a berth again, jist
for to go and have another." One of
us looked to the other, and Miss Hyde
laughed and coloured a bit when I
offered her a second, while her father
said full five minutes after, "'Gad,
Violet, it almost made me think I saw
Garden Reach in the Hooghly, and
the Baboo's Ghaut!"</p>

<p>This whole time we couldn't have
got more than three-quarters of a mile
from where the ship lay, when all at
once the close growth on our left hand
began to break into low bush, and at
length a spot offered where we might
get ashore tolerably, with two or three
big red ant-hills heaped up out of the
close prickly-pear plant, and the black
ants streaming over the bank, as well
as up the trunk of a large tree. The
monkies were keeping up a chattering
stir everywhere about; and two or
three bright-green little lizards changing
into purple, and back again, as
they lay gleaming in the sun on the
sides of the ant-heaps, and darted
their long tongues out like silver
bodkins at the ants coming past. In
we shoved with a cheer, and had
scarce moored to the tree ere the
ladies were being handed out and
tripping over the ground-leaves to
the ankles, starting on again at every
rustle and prick, for fear of snakes;
till the bowman in charge was left in
the boat by himself, and, there being
seven of us with guns over our arms,
the next notion of the griffins was to
get a sight of some "natives."</p>

<p>In fact there was a sort of a half
track leading off near the bank,
through among the long coarse grass
and the ferny sprouts of young cocoas,
and a wide stretch of open country
seen beyond it, dotted all over with
low clumps of trees and bush rounded
off in the gush of light, that gave it
all a straw-coloured tint up to where
a bare reddish-looking ridge of hill
looked over a long swell of wild forest,
off a hot, pale, cloudless sky. Here
and there you saw the shadow of one
bluff lying purple on the side of
another, and a faint blue peak between,
letting north'ard into some
pass through the hills, but no signs
of life save a few dun big-headed
buffaloes feeding about a swampy spot
not very far off, and rather too shaggy,
by all appearance, to make pleasant
company. Accordingly, we held for
a few yards under the shade, where
the fat mid, thinking to show off his
knowingness by getting cocoa-nuts
for the ladies, began to shy balls of
mud from the creek-side at the monkeys
in the trees. However, he brought
us rather more than he bargained for,
till the whole blessed jungle seemed
to be gathering between us and the
boat to pelt us to death with nuts as
big as eighteen-pound shot, husks and
all; so off we had to hurry into the
glare again, Sir Charles half carrying
his daughter through guinea-grass up
to the waist&mdash;when somebody felt the
smell of smoke, and next minute we
broke out near it, wreathing up white
from inside a high bamboo fence,
propped up and tied all along with
cocoa-nut husk. "What the devil!"
shouted the foremost cadet, as soon
as he found the opening, "they're
cannibals!&mdash;roasting a black child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
by heaven!" and in he dashed, being
no chicken of a fellow <em>ashore</em> at any
rate, the others after him, while the
Judge, Simm, and I, kept outside
with the ladies, who were all of a
shudder, of course, what with the
thought, and what with the queer
scent of roast meat that came to us.
"Ha, ha!" laughed the cadet next
moment, "it's only a monkey, after
all!&mdash;come in, though, Sir Charles, if
you please, sir,&mdash;nobody here, ladies."
There, accordingly, was the little
skinned object twirling slowly between
two bamboo sticks, over a fire
beneath two or three immense green
leaves on a frame, with its knees up
not to let its legs burn; about a dozen
half-open sheds and huts, like little
corn-stacks, thatched close with reeds,
and hung with wattled mats of split
bamboo, giving the place more the
look of a farmyard than a village; as
there was a big tree spreading in the
middle, a few plantains, yams, and
long maize-stalks flowering out of the
coarse guinea-grass which the niggers
hadn't taken the trouble to tread
down all round inside of the fence.
However, we weren't long of perceiving
an old gray-headed black sitting
on his hams against the post of a
hut, watching us all the time; and a
villanously ugly old thief he looked,
with a string of Aggry beads about his
head, and a greegree charm-bag hung
round his shrivelled neck, which was
stuck through a hole in some striped
piece of stuff that fell over to his
knees, as he sat mumbling and croaking
to himself, and leering out of the
yellows of his eyes, though too helpless
to stir. Something out of the way attracted
my notice, glittering in front
of the hut over his head; but, on stepping
up to it, I wasn't a little surprised
to find it the stern-board of
some small vessel or other, with the
tarnished gilt ornament all round,
and the name in large white letters,&mdash;"Martha
Cobb,"&mdash;the port, Boston,
still to be made out, smaller, below.
This I didn't think so much of in
itself, as the craft might have been
lost; till, on noticing that the old
fellow's robe was neither more nor
less than a torn American ensign, in
spite of his growls and croaks I walked
past him into the hut, where there
was a whole lot of marlinspikes, keys,
and such like odds and ends, carefully
stored up in a bag, marked with the
same name, besides a stewpan with
some ostrich feathers stuck where the
handle had been, as if this rascally
black sinner wore it on his head on
state occasions, being probably the
head-man and a justice of the peace!
What struck me most, though, was a
pocket-book with a letter inside it, in
a woman's hand, addressed to the
master of the brig Martha Cobb;
dated a dozen years before, yellow
and fusty, and with tarry finger-marks
on it, as if the poor skipper, God
knows, had read it over and over
in his cabin many a fresh breeze
betwixt there and Boston. I put it
in my pocket, with a curse to the old
black devil, as he croaked out and fell
on his face trying to bite me with his
filed teeth when I passed out, to follow
the rest out of the bamboo pen;
wondering, of course, where all the
negroes could be, unless they were
dodging about the river shore to watch
the Indiaman,&mdash;little chance as there
was of their trying the same joke
with the Seringapatam, as with the
Martha Cobb.</p>

<p>As for the women, however, I had
scarce joined our party going out,
when we met a half-naked black hag
with a bunch of cocoa-nuts and husk.
The moment she saw us she gave a
squeal like an old hen, and fell flat,
while several younger ones, jogging
along with their naked black picaninnies
on their backs, turned tail and
were off with a scream. Next minute
we were almost as startled as they
could be, when three plump young
jetty damsels dropped down right
into the bushes alongside of us, off as
many tall cocoas which they'd been
climbing by a band round them, for the
nuts. "Mercy on us!" said the eldest
of our lady-passengers: and it <em>was</em>
rather queer, since they had nothing
earthly upon them save very very
short pet&mdash;I beg your pardon ma'am,
but I didn't know any other word&mdash;however
off they scampered for the
woods, Simm and one of the cadets
hard after them, and we turning away
to smother our laughter, especially as
the griffin had forgot his mother being
with us. The middy being first
started, he was a good way ahead,
when all at once the sternmost of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
black girls tripped in the band she
had over her shoulder, Simm giving
a cheer as he made prize of his chase;
but scarce before the whole three of
the dark beauties had him smothered
up amongst them, laughing, yelling,
and squalling as they hauled him about;
till I saw the dirk Simm sported
glitter in one of their hands, and I
made towards the spot in the notion
of their finishing him in right earnest.
The black damsels ran off together
as the unlucky reefer picked himself
up, coming to us with his hair rubbed
up like a brush, his cap out of shape
in his hand and the gold band off it,
his red face shining, and all the gilt
anchor-buttons off his jacket, besides
being minus his dirk. "Simm! Simm!
my fine fellow!" said his friend the
cadet, like to die with laughing,
"what&mdash;what&mdash;did they do to you?
why, your head looks like a chimney-sweep's
mop!" Simm knocked his cap
against a tree to set it right, without
a word, and we followed the others to
the boat, where he swore, however,
that he'd kissed 'em all three; at
which Mrs Atkins fairly took him a
slap on the side of the head, saying
he was a nasty improper boy, and she
was glad <em>his</em> poor mother couldn't see
him run after creatures of that kind in
African woods&mdash;"Natives, indeed!"
said she, "I have heard so often of
native modesty, too, in books; but,
after all, there's nothing like experience,
I think, Sir Charles?" "Certainly
not, ma'am," replied the Judge,
humouring her, as she hadn't often
had the chance of speaking to him
before; "'tis almost as bad in India,
though, you know!" "Oh, <em>there</em>, Sir
Charles," said the lady, "I never
happened to go out, of course, except
in the carriage!" "Ah," said the
Judge coolly, "you should try an
elephant sometimes, ma'am."</p>

<p>After this, as Sir Charles was bent
on getting a shot at something better,
with a glass or two of Madeira to
refresh us, we pulled farther still up
the small river, passing the mouth of
a deep marshy inlet, where I noticed
a few long canoes belonging to the
Congo village we had seen; the close,
heavy heat of the woods getting if
possible worse, and the rank green
growth topping up round us as flat
as before; when the sound of a loud
rush of water up-stream broke upon
us through the bush to northward,
the surface rippling, and a slight cool
breath seeming to flutter across it now
and then, the very noise putting fresh
soul into you. Suddenly we opened
out on a broad bend where it was
hard work to force her round, and next
moment a low fall was gleaming before
us, where a hill-stream came washing
and plashing over one wide rocky
step above another in the turn, then
sweeping out of a deep pool to both
hands, and running away ahead, in between
the spread of trees, seemingly to
a sort of a lagoon, where you saw the
light in the middle glancing bright
down upon its face. A broad blue
burst of air and light struck down
along the hollow the stream rushed
out of, off the roots of a regular mountain,
leaning back to the sky, with its
big tufted knolls and its shady rifts
thrown out blue beyond one or two
thick scaly-stemmed date-trees, waving
their long, feathery, fringe-like
leaves to the least bit of a breeze, on
as many rough points near at hand:
the <em>whole</em> shape of the mountain you
couldn't see for the huge mahogany
trees, teak, and African oak, rising up
over one shoulder into a lump of
green forest. In five minutes more
we were through into the lagoon,
which very possibly took round into
the main river again, only the opposite
end, to our surprise, was all afloat
with logs of big timber choking it up,
so that there we must stick or go
back upon our wake.</p>

<p>However, the lagoon itself being
broad enough and round enough in
all conscience, with a deep hollow
opening up out of it on the high
ground, the Judge and the cadets
thought a better place couldn't have
been chosen for landing after a little
sport, while we left the fair ladies to
rest in the cool, and look at the lotus-lilies
spread all over one cove of it,
floating white on their large leaves.
The green edge of scum ran about the
black shadow on the rest of it, gathering
round where a big branch or two
had fallen in, with the hot white sky
looking bluer out through the broad
leaves coming together aloft, and the
showers of little sharp ones in the
tamarind twigs, mangoes, iron-wood,
sumach, and all sorts; while here and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
there a knot of crimson blossoms
looked out from under the boughs in
the dark, humming with small flies.
Beautiful spot as it was everyway, especially
after the heat, yet I didn't
much like the idea of letting the ladies
stay by themselves, except the sailor
and the kitmagar. Nothing particular
had turned up to trouble us, certainly;
but I daresay 'twas because there was
<em>one</em> of them I never looked at without
her soft fairy-like air making me think
of something that might happen to her,
life-like though she seemed. When I
saw a big branch over her head, I kept
fancying what it would do if it fell&mdash;
and now, the thumping slabs and
stones we scrambled over up into the
gully toward the mountain, seemed to
have come tumbling down off it to the
very water's edge, covered with nets
of thick creeping plants, and trails of
flat fingery-leaved flowers, such as
you see in hot-houses at home. A
few yards higher, too, where the
ground broke away into a slanting
hollow out of the bush, 'twas all
trampled and crushed, half-withering
together in the heat of the sun, the
young trees twisted and broken, and
two or three good-sized ones lying out
from the roots, which I set to the
score of the timberers rolling down
their logs, for some craft that evidently
got their cargoes hereaway.
After all, the thought of a slap at
some wild game was tempting enough,
the Judge appearing to consider any
one but a sportsman nobody at all:
so up we went behind him out of the
gully, till we were all blowing like so
many porpoises on the head of it, Sir
Charles raising his finger as we peeped
across a grassy slope right under us,
where a whole drove of small slender-legged
antelopes were feeding. We
had just time to rest, getting a breath
of air off the heights, when one of the
foremost lifted its head, listening the
opposite way from us; next moment
the entire scatter of them came
sweeping direct over to leeward in a
string,&mdash;we could almost catch their
bright black eyes through the grass,
when the crack of our seven barrels
turned them bolt off at a corner, and
they were gone like wind on water.
All of us had missed save Sir Charles
Hyde; but his rifle-bullet had sent one
of the antelopes springing up in the air
ten feet or so, rolling over and over
into the grass again, where we found
it lying with its tongue out, and its
large eye glazing amongst the blades
and dust&mdash;a pair of huge turkey-buzzards
falling, as it were, out of two
specks in the sun above us, already,
and rising with an ugly flap while we
got round the dead creature.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said the mid, suddenly,
looking back over toward the hollow
we'd come out of; "what's that?"</p>

<p>From where we stood we could just
see through the wild cane to the mouth
of the gully, half a mile down or
more, leading upon the trees by the
lagoon. I thought I could hear a dull
heavy sound now and then going
thump thump down the hollow and
along it, the stones rumbling from one
spot to another at the root of the hill;
but noticing a light smoke rising farther
into the course of the creek, with
a faint echo of axes at work somewhere
in the woods below, I wasn't
sorry to find the timberers were still
in the river, showing we weren't the
only civilised folks that thought it fit
to visit. Perhaps it might have been
a quarter of an hour more, however,
and we were all looking out sharp for
birds of any kind to pop at, happening
to turn my head, I saw the long
reeds were moving about the banks
below, and the trees twisting about
furiously; and no sooner had I made a
few paces than, good heavens!&mdash;right
in the break of the trees at the landing-place&mdash;<em>there</em>
was a huge brute of some
sort coming slowly up out of the
water; then another, and another,
glistening wet in the bright light as
the shadow of the branches slipped
behind them. A blindness came over
my eyes, and I had scarce time to
make out the big block-like heads and
moving trunks of five or six black
African elephants, ere the whole case
flashed upon me, and away I dashed
full speed down the slope. The big
beasts were turning quietly off into
the hollow, and two or three of their
calves trotted after them out of the
bushes, munching the young cane-stalks
as they lifted their pillars of
legs, and their tufty little tails, when
I passed a fire of sticks blazing under
a slab of rock, with the Judge's guinea-fowl
plucked and roasting before
it from a string, the bowman's tarpaulin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
and his pipe lying near by&mdash;a
sight that doubled the horror in me,
to know he had left the boat at all;
and no doubt, as I thought, taken
fright and run off, man-o'-war's-man
though he was. I made three springs
over the stones down to the water,
terrified to look in, hearing it, as I did,
splash and wash about the sides, up
among the leaves of the trees; while a
couple of monstrous brutes were to be
seen by the light in the midst of it, still
wallowing about, and seeming to enjoy
sending the whole pool in wide
rings and waves as far as it would go,
with the noise besides: the one half
swimming, and the biggest standing
aground as he poured the water out of
his long trunk all over his back, then
broke off a branch and waved it to
and fro like a fan round his flapping
leathery ears.</p>

<p>Such a moment I hope never to
know again&mdash;not the least sign of the
boat could I see in the green black
blink of the place, after the glare
above; and I stood like a madman at
the thought of what the herd of monsters
had <em>done</em>, when they came suddenly
down upon it; then I gave a
wild cry, and levelled my ship's musket
at the big elephant's head, as he
brought his small cunning eye slowly
to bear upon me, dropped the branch,
and began to swing his forehead, all
the time looking at me and wading
out to the shallow&mdash;by Jove! my
flesh creeps at it <em>just now</em>&mdash;though I
couldn't have stirred for worlds till he
was close enough for me to fire into
that devilish eye of his. 'Twas no
more than the matter of half a minute&mdash;till
you may fancy what I felt to
catch sight all at once of the cutter
splashing up and down in the gloom
below the branches, the ladies and the
Hindoo crouching down terrified together,
except Violet Hyde, who stood
straight, holding the boat firm in by a
bough, her white face fixed through
the shadow, and her hair floating out
of her straw-bonnet each time her
head went up among the leaves, with
her glittering eyes on the two elephants.
Suddenly some heavy black
figure dropped almost right over her
into the boat, and she let go with a low
cry, and sank down with her hands
over her eyes; when they went sheering
out towards the creek, the fore-topman
handling his boat-hook in her
bow, without his tarpaulin. As for
the wild elephants, I had just time to
come to myself before the foremost
had his feet on the stones below me,
getting cautiously out of the pool;
these awkward antics of theirs being
possibly signs of too much satisfaction
in a bathe, for them to show aught like
fury, if you didn't rouse them; so I
was slipping quietly round the nearest
tree when I heard the cadets halloing
up the hill. The old bull-elephant
seemed a dangerous customer to meet,
and I was hurrying over the dead
grass and branches to give warning,
just as Sir Charles Hyde could be
seen coming down before the rest, his
rifle over his shoulder. However he
brought up, the moment I sang out to
stop: both the elephants were stalking
off lower down into the hollow,
and I dropped behind the slab where
Tom Wilkes had been roasting his
bird, when some fool of a cadet let
drive at the bull-elephant from above,
hitting him fair on the front. You
heard the rifle-bullet hit slap against
it as if on an anvil: the she-elephant
made off at a fast trot, but the big
brute himself turned round on the
moment, lifting his trunk straight
aloft with a sharp trumpeting scream
through it, and looked round till his
small red eye lighted on the Judge,
who seemed quite out of breath from
his sport.</p>

<p>"The fire! that fire, for God's sake,
Mr Westwood, else I am lost!" called
out Sir Charles, in a calm distinct key
from where he stood with his eye fixed
on the elephant, and could see me, too,&mdash;a
moment or two before the huge
round-backed lump of a brute came
running round into the track, stumbling
heavily up the dead branches of
the fallen trees and the dry guinea-grass,
with a savage roar between his
two white tusks&mdash;and I saw what the
Judge meant, just in time to throw
over the whole heap of flaming cocoa-tree
husk among the withered grass
and stuff a few yards before the
monster, as dry as tinder, while the
light air coming down the gully of
the mountain, drove it spreading
across his course up through the
twigs, and sweeping in one sudden
gust of fire up to the very end of his
trunk. I saw it lift over the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
like a black serpent, then another
scream from the brute, and away he
was charging into the hollow again,
the flame licking up among the grass
astern of him, and darting from one
bough to another towards the cane-brake
below. I had scarce drawn a
long breath, and remembered the
devil's own thought that had come into
my head when the Judge called to me,
ere he slapped me on the shoulder.
"You did nobly there, my dear boy,"
said Sir Charles; "managed it well!
'Gad, it was a crisis, though, Mr
Westwood!" "I'm afraid, however,
sir," said I, eying the crackling bushes,
smoking and whitening to a dead
smoulder in the sunlight, then flashing
farther down as the hill-breeze
rustled off, "I'm afraid we shall
have the woods burning about our
ears!" Down we hurried accordingly,
and hailed the cutter, where
scarce had we leisure to pass a few
quick words and tumble in, before I
heard a shout beyond the other turn
of the creek, through the end of the
lagoon; then something like the cheep
of ropes through blocks, with the
bustle of men's feet on a deck, and
next minute a perfect hubbub of cries,
whether Dutch, Portuguese, English,
or all together, I couldn't say,&mdash;only
it wasn't likely the <em>last</em> would kick up
such a bother for nothing. Four or
five Kroomen came leaping round and
along the float of logs at the far end,
their large straw hats shining in the
light over their jet faces, as they
peered across into the lagoon. The
minute after they vanished, we saw
the white upper spars of a schooner
slide above the farthest of the wood,
and her bowsprit shoved past the
turn just enough to show her sharp
lead-coloured bow, with the mouth of
a gun out of a port, and a fellow
blowing the red end of his match behind
it. All at once the chorus of
shouts and cries ceased, and a single
voice sang out along the water, clear,
stern, and startling, in bad Portuguese,
"<i>Queren sieté?</i> who are you?" Still
we gave no answer, quietly shoving
off as fast as we could, the flicker of
the fire in the brake behind the trees
beginning to show itself through the
black shade of the lagoon. "<i>Queren
siete?</i>" sang out the voice, louder
than before, in a threatening way,
and the logs were knocking and plashing
before the schooner as the Kroomen
hauled at them to make an opening.
"Amigos! Amigos!" hailed we
in turn; "Ingleses, gentlemen!" shouted
the cadet who knew Portuguese,
calling to them not to fire, for heaven-sake,
else they would do us some
harm. With this, the hubbub was
worse than before; they plainly had
some design on us, from the confusion
that got up; but by that time
we were pulling hard into the narrow
of the river, and took the fair current
of it as soon as the boat was past the
falling stream we had seen before, till
we were round into the next reach.</p>

<p>In fact the rate we all bent our
backs at this time, was pretty different
from coming up: the cadets
seemed hardly to feel the heat, fierce
and close though it was, at thought
of those that might be in our wake,
and nobody spoke a word at ease till
at last, after an hour's hard work,
taking it in turns, we came full in
sight of the Indiaman at her anchor
on the broad current. The ladies
blessed the very ropes hanging from
her bowsprit, and we got safe aboard,
where we found the two other boats
had come back long before; and every
one of us turned in directly after sundown,
as tired as dogs.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't suppose I had slept
an hour, dreaming terribly wild sort
of dreams about Violet Hyde and
elephants, then that I'd saved her
myself, and was stooping to kiss her
rosy lips, when a sudden noise on
deck startled me,&mdash;I shoved myself
into my clothes and rushed on the
quarterdeck. She had gone aground
at her stern in swinging, in the water
the Portuguese rascal gave her, canted
a little over to starboard, away
from the shore; and till morning
flood nothing could be done to haul
her off. The fog was rolling down
with the land-breeze, and the jabber
in the woods, again, thickened the
confusion; when all at once a dim
flash off the shore glimmered in the
white fog, and a round-shot whistled
just astern, pretty well aimed for her
bilge, which would have cost us some
work if it had hit. After that, however,
there was no more of it, the
fellow probably having spent either
all his powder or his balls. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
his fort, I heard the chief officer
swearing he would knock it about
his ears next day&mdash;a thing that couldn't
have done him much harm, certainly,
unless mud were dear.</p>

<p>No sooner had the men gone below,
leaving the ordinary anchor-watch,
than Mr Finch, to my great surprise,
walked up to me, and gave me a
strange suspicious look, hinting that
he began to have a good guess of
what I really was, but if anything
new of the kind turned up, said he,
he should know better what to say to
me. "Mr Finch," said I, starting,
"this won't do, sir&mdash;you'll either
speak your mind before cabin and
cuddy, or to-morrow morning, by
Jove! you'll go quietly ashore with
me, sir&mdash;as I think, now you remind
me of it, we settled to do, already!"
The mate's face whitened, and he eyed
me with a glare of malice, as I turned
on my heel and began to walk the
quarterdeck till he went below.</p>

<p>However, the thought of the thing
stuck to me, and I kept walking in
the dark to get rid of it: the four or
five men of the anchor-watch shuffling
lazily about, and all thick save ahead
up the river, where the land-breeze
blew pretty strong, bringing now and
then a faint gleam out of the mist. I
was leaning against the fore-chains,
listening to the ebb-tide, and thinking;
when I saw one of the men creeping
in from the bowsprit, which you
just saw, where it ran up thick into
the dusk, with scarce a glimpse of the
jib-boom and flying-jib-boom beyond.
The sailor came up touching his hat
to me, and said he thought he saw
something queer off the boom-end.
"Well," said I gruffly, "go and tell
your mate, then." I didn't know the
fellow's voice, though it had a particular
twang in it, and he wasn't in
Jacob's watch, I knew. "Why,
your honour," he persisted, "I knows
pretty well what you air&mdash;asking your
pardon, sir&mdash;but I think you'd make
more out of it nor any of the mates!&mdash;It's
some'at rather skeary, sir!"
added he. Accordingly I took hold
of the man-ropes and swung myself
up the bowsprit, and had my feet on
the foot-rope below the jib-boom,
when I heard his breath, following
behind me. "Never you trouble
yourself, my man," said I; "one at a
time!" and back he went in board
again&mdash;for something curious in his
way struck me, but I wanted to see
what he meant. I had just got near
the flying-jib, half-stowed in as it was
on the boom, and I fancied, with a
creep of my blood in me, I made out
a man's head over the sail; but next
moment a hand like a vice caught me
by the throat, and some one growled
out&mdash;"Now ye infarnal man-o'-war
hound, I have ye&mdash;and down you
goes for it!" The instant I <em>felt</em> it,
my coolness came back; as for
grappling, I couldn't, and the ebb
current ran below to her bows at a
rate fit to carry one out to sea in
half an hour. I saw the whole plot
in a twinkling, and never moved;
instead of that I gave a sort of laugh,
and followed the husky twang of the
other man to a tee. "He won't come,
Harry, my lad!" said I, and my ugly
friend let go before he had time to think
twice. "He be blowed!" said Harry,
scornfully; "an' why won't he, mate?"
He had scarce the words out of his
mouth, though, ere I took him a
twist that doubled him over the spar,
and down he slipped, hanging by a
clutch of the sail. "I suppose, my
fine fellow," said I, "you forgot
Fernando Po, and those nigger adventures
of yours&mdash;eh?"&mdash;and I
went in without more ado.</p>

<p>I hadn't been ten minutes on deck,
however, when I heard both of them
swearing something or other to the
first mate. A little after Finch came
forward to me, with a ship's-lantern,
and three or four of the men behind.
"Mr Collins, or whatever's your
name, sir," said he aloud, "I believe
you've been seen just now at the
bowsprit-end, making signals or something
to the shore! You're in arrest
at once, sir, and no more about it!"
"What the deuce!" said I, my blood
up, and pulling out a pair of pocket-pistols
I had had in the boat, "let
me see the man to&mdash;" At the moment
a blow of a handspike from near the
mast laid me senseless on the deck,
and I knew nothing more.&mdash;&mdash;But
I see 'tis too far gone in the night to
carry out the yarn, ladies!</p>

<h2>BRITISH AGRICULTURE AND FOREIGN COMPETITION.</h2>


<p>"I do say it is for the public advantage
that I should say to him,
(the farmer,) continue your improvements:
I cannot undertake to guarantee
to you, by legislation, a particular
price; <span class="smcap">but this I will say,
that as long as corn is under
51s., you shall not be exposed
to the importation of foreign
corn</span>." So spoke Sir Robert Peel
in February 1842, as the proposer of
an excellent law for the improved regulation
of the corn trade. The pledge
was a distinct one; and the very
homeliness of the language saves it
from equivocal construction. In the
course of the same debate, Sir Robert,
with just and prudent caution, expressly
abstained from committing
himself to the obviously fallacious
doctrine of a fixed remunerative price.
He held, as we hold, that, according
to varying circumstances, that remunerating
price must vary. He did
not, and could not, forget that, under
war prices and war taxes, wheat
could not be cultivated with profit in
this country, unless the quarter sold
for 80s.; neither was he blind to the
fact, that we had seen the average price
so low in 1835 as 39s. 4d., notwithstanding
the operation of a highly protective
law. But he also held that, although
it was impossible, with all the aids
which agricultural experiment and
statistical science could bring, to fix
an immutable price for the quarter of
wheat&mdash;as he had previously done in
the instance of the ounce of gold&mdash;still,
from averages taken throughout
the country for a series of years, it
was possible to frame some general
proximate conclusion, which the legislature
was bound to keep in mind,
whilst considering any laws or alterations
of rates that might hereafter
affect the interests of the British farmer.
So that, when Sir Robert Peel
enunciated the following opinions, we
maintain that the principle which guided
him was strictly correct; and we
accept these as embodying the main
argument that led to the conclusion,
which we have placed above as the
commencement and the text of this
article. "Now, with reference to the
probable remunerating price, I should
say that, for the protection of the
agricultural interest, as far as I can
possibly form a judgment, if the price
of wheat in this country, allowing for
its natural oscillations, could be limited
to some such amount as between
54s. and 58s., I do not believe that it
is for the interest of the agriculturist
that it should be higher. Take the
average of the last ten years, excluding
from some portion of the average
the extreme prices of the last three
years, and 56s. would be found to be
the average; and so far as I can
form an idea of what would constitute
a fair remunerating price, <span class="smcap">I, for one,
should never wish to see it vary
more than I have said</span>. I cannot
say, on the other hand, that I am
able to see any great or permanent
advantage to be derived from the
diminution of the price of corn <em>beyond
the lowest amount I have named</em>,
if I look at the subject in connexion
with the general position of the country,
the existing relations of landlord
and tenant, the burdens upon the
land, and the habits of the country."</p>

<p>These opinions are quite distinct,
and from them we gather that Sir
Robert Peel, in 1842, considered that,
on an average, 54s. was the lowest
price at which the British farmer could
raise wheat for the market&mdash;so long,
at least, as he was liable to the same
burdens as formerly, occupied the
same position in the country, and
paid the same rent to his landlord.
Following out these views, Sir Robert
Peel introduced his sliding-scale of
duties, and the result would seem in
a great measure to vindicate his sagacity.
Let us take the averages for
the six years immediately following:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="years">
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="left"><em>s.</em>&nbsp; <em>d.</em></td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">1842,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="right">57</td><td align="right">3</td></tr>

</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the average
price of wheat, during those years,
<em>was within fivepence</em> of the calculation
made by Sir Robert as the fair and
natural average for the preceding ten
years, and that it almost hit the precise
medium between the two extremes
which he assumed.</p>

<p>Now, we are not aware that Sir
Robert Peel has ever <em>directly</em> retracted
these opinions, although many passages
might be quoted from his speeches
to show that he considered increased
cheapness&mdash;the necessary result of his
free-trade measures&mdash;some sort of
compensation for the probable decline
in the value of agricultural produce.
But the income-tax and increased
public burdens may fairly be set
against any saving on the ground of
cheapness, and the question remains
precisely where it was before. The
averages of sixteen years, excluding
extraordinary impulses to an unnatural
rise or fall, entitle us to assume
that the British farmer cannot raise
wheat profitably at lower prices than
56s. per quarter; and Sir Robert
Peel, whatever may be the effect of
his subsequent measures, once gave
his solemn guarantee that, when prices
should fall below 51s., there should
be no foreign competition.</p>

<p>We have no desire to rake up old
matters of discussion, or to reflect upon
pledges which may either have lapsed
or been broken. Our present business
with Sir Robert is simply to have his
evidence as to the remunerating prices
of corn, and that evidence we have
stated above. We are, therefore, entitled
to assume that any great and
permanent decline of prices, following
upon increased foreign imports, must
have a most deleterious effect upon
the agriculture of the country, unless
some remedy can be found which shall
lessen the cost of production. As
usual, there is no lack of volunteers
to suggest remedies. Dr Buckland,
of iguanodon and icthyosaurus celebrity,
discourses learnedly of subsoils
and manures, and offers to show how
acres of wheat may be raised upon
soils hitherto yielding no other crop
than rushes, ling, or heather. It is
the misfortune of scientific men that
they live in a world of their own; for,
had the learned fossilist been aware
of what has been passing around for
the last twenty years, he would have
known that no sane person ever questioned
the truth of his assertions.
With the aid of draining, manure, and
other artificial appliances, corn may
be grown almost anywhere within the
compass of the British islands. No
man disputes that. The simple question
is: Will the corn, when grown,
yield a fair return for the expenses
attendant upon its growth? Until the
geologists and chemists have acquired
so much real practical knowledge as
to be able to answer this query satisfactorily,
they will best consult the
public interest by confining themselves
to their quarries and their laboratories.
That agriculturist who should
deny the advantages which his own
science has derived from the aid of
chemistry, would not only be an ungrateful,
but an exceedingly unreasonable
man; nevertheless, he cannot
be charged with either ingratitude or
folly if, after calculating the cost of
the productive agent, and the value
of the produce, he declines to expend
his capital in forced improvements,
which at the end of the year, and with
diminished prices, must leave him a
considerable loser. If high farming
could be shown to be productive, high
farming would be the rule and not the
exception. In Scotland we have
farmed so high, that we are quoted at
all hands as an example to the rest
of the world. If we mistake not, Dr
Buckland himself, in some of his stimulating
addresses, has referred to
the agricultural system of the Lothians
as a specimen, or rather <em>the</em> specimen,
of what may be achieved by science
combined with energy. We accept
the compliment; and in the course of
the following pages we shall endeavour
to show him, and his friends, how
the pattern farmer is likely to fare,
and how he has fared already, under
the operation of the new code
which modern liberalism has introduced
for the encouragement of British
enterprise.</p>

<p>Next to the chemists, and moving
closely in their wake, come the free-trading
landlords who assented to the
great experiment. If we select Lords
Ducie and Kinnaird as fair specimens
of this class in England and in Scotland,
we shall do no more than give
that prominence to their names which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
is challenged by their late assertions.
Our occupancy of the Scottish field,
from which we are unwilling to depart,
precludes us from entering into any
investigation of the views promulgated
by the English earl. But we have no
scruple at all in dealing with the Scottish
baron, who, in the letter of advice
addressed to his tenantry of the Carse
of Gowrie, has taken infinite pains to
show that the superior husbandry of
Scotland has been stimulated, if not
created, by the exaction of high rents;
and, by an easy corollary, that future
improvement depends mainly upon the
maintenance of these rents, irrespective
altogether of the decline in the
value of produce! This, we are bound
to admit, is a comfortable landlord's
theory; and, if the agricultural tenants
who frequent the reading-room at
Inchture are convinced of its practical
soundness, we should be extremely
sorry to utter a single word which
might tend to unsettle their faith.
But we fear that Lord Kinnaird, like
many other inconsiderate individuals,
has committed a serious mistake in
rushing precipitately into print. We
agree with him, on the whole, that
rent is a desirable thing, which ought
not, under ordinary circumstances, to
be violently diminished; still we must
adhere to our deliberate opinion, that,
if a great organic change, affecting the
interests of agriculture to a serious
degree, is consequent upon any measures
of the legislature, both landlord
and tenant must be prepared to suffer
in a certain ratio. It is all very well
to recommend the aid of chemistry,
provided, at the same time, that adequate
capital is forthcoming. Even
with capital, to be drawn from the
tenant's, and not the landlord's pocket,
it will require more than mere assertion
to persuade the former that,
by an enormously increased outlay in
phosphate of lime, sulphuric acid,
magnesia, manganese, gypsum, guano,
and what not, he may raise crops the
abundance of which shall compensate
him for a direct loss of 16s. or 20s. on
the quarter of wheat, with a corresponding
diminution in the value of
every other kind of agricultural produce.
Some of those who, according
to Lord Kinnaird, have shown themselves
"the best and most successful
farmers," men who have heretofore
been engaged in business&mdash;that
is, commercial business&mdash;may
be induced to try the experiment;
but if there be any truth in the
reply which Mr Thomas Ross of
Wardheads, a farmer in the Carse of
Gowrie, has made to his lordship's
pamphlet, the result of the trials
hitherto attempted by such enterprising
persons, upon the Kinnaird estates
and in the immediate neighbourhood,
may be best estimated by a perusal
of the <cite>Gazette</cite>, wherein the names of
divers unfortunate speculators are
recorded. But, to speak plainly, the
time has gone by for any such absurd
trifling. What we want are facts,
not theories; least of all, theories so
palpably preposterous as to carry
their refutation on their face.</p>

<p>We do not, by any means, intend
to insinuate that Lord Kinnaird is to
be taken as a type of the Scottish or
British landlords. On the contrary,
we believe that he forms one of a
minority so infinitesimally small, that
the number of them would hardly be
worth the reckoning. The position of
the landlord and the tenant is, on the
clearest of all grounds, inseparable;
and it is in vain to suppose that the
one class can, by possibility, have a
distinct interest from the other. No
doubt, during the currency of existing
leases, entered into before the rapid
conversion of the two great political
rivals to the doctrines of free trade,
the landlord may insist upon having
the full penalty of his bond, and may
wring the last farthing from the hand
of the despairing farmer. We are
living in times when vested interests
have lost their character of sanctity:
the legislature, while forcing down
prices, provided no remedy for the
relief of those who were tied up by
bargains, reasonable when contracted,
but ruinous under the altered circumstances;
and the tenant, though forced
to struggle against the might of foreign
importation, has no legal claim on the
proprietor of the soil for a corresponding
deduction from his rent. But the
good feeling which has always existed
between the landlords and the tenantry
of this country, if we assume no higher
motive, will doubtless operate, in the
majority of instances, to temper the
rigour of the bargain, should the pressure
continue to increase; and year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
after year, as leases expire, and as
the results of practical experience become
more generally understood, competition
will disappear, and rents fall
to a point exactly corresponding to
the expectation of future prices. It
is a bad sign of the times, though
certainly an instructive one, when we
find a wealthy peer, in a letter addressed
to his tenantry, expressing
his opinion that retired tradesmen and
others&mdash;men who have never handled
a plough in their lives, and who are
far better versed in the mysteries of
long-stitch than in those of draining&mdash;make
much better farmers than those
who have been reared to agriculture
from their infancy. According
to this view, the farmer is a mere
booby compared to the man whose
intellects have been sharpened in the
shop, the counting-house, or the manufactory;
and the experience which
he has gained positively unfits him for
the actual exercise of his profession!
Such views must be corroborated by the
testimony of deeper sages than Lord
Kinnaird, before they pass into general
acceptation; and we cannot help
thinking that the noble author would
have used a wise discretion had he
been less explicit in his reasons for
preferring the novice to the practised
farmer. Besides their habits of accurate
accounting, and their total freedom
from prejudice, retired tradesmen
appear valuable, in the eyes of Lord
Kinnaird, for two especial reasons:&mdash;"In
the first place, that they have
capital; secondly, that they are not
afraid to expend it, knowing that thus
alone can their land be made productive."
To such persons we would
address a word of warning, cautioning
them to use their acquired powers of
accounting rather before than after
they enter into any agricultural bargain;
and in particular, we would
advise them to look narrowly to the
figures of their noble encourager, detailing
the results of his own experience
in the farm of Mill-hill, brought
down, with great show of accuracy, to
the close of 1847&mdash;<em>before</em> protection
ceased, or prices fell&mdash;<em>but no later</em>. In
the course of such investigations, they
may light upon an anomaly or so
which no arithmetician can explain,
and be rather chary of receiving his
lordship's dogmas, that remuneration
from farming is "<em>not dependent
on high prices</em>," and that "no one
possessing capital need be afraid of
investing it in a farm."</p>

<p>The last champion of increased
production as an antidote against free
trade, is not the type of a class, but a
single individual&mdash;whose testimony,
however, being in some respects practical,
is worth more than that of all
the chemical doctors and interested
landlords put together. We allude to
Mr James Caird, whose pamphlet,
entitled "High Farming under Liberal
Covenants, the best Substitute for
Protection," has already excited so
much attention, that, if rumour does
not err, its author has been deputed
by government, at the recommendation
of Sir Robert Peel, to visit Ireland
with the view of reporting upon
the agricultural capabilities of that
country. We shall presently have
occasion to examine the details of
that pamphlet, as minutely as their
importance deserves; at present we
shall merely note, in passing, that it
does not profess to set forth the results
of the author's <em>own</em> practical experience,
although Mr Caird is well
known to be a farmer of great intelligence
and ability; and, further, that
it directly points to <em>liberal covenants</em>
on the part of the landlord as an indispensable
basis of the arrangement.
In fact, therefore, we find that Lord
Kinnaird and Mr Caird, though both
writing on the same side, entertain
views widely differing from each
other, as to the future terms of adjustment
between the two great agricultural
classes. Lord Kinnaird is for
"high rents;" Mr Caird for "liberal
covenants." It is impossible that
both of them can be right; and were
we to join issue solely upon the facts
which each of them has adduced, we
should have no hesitation in deciding
in favour of the practical farmer.
But we apprehend that, even with the
aid of liberal covenants, Mr Caird
has failed in making out his case, as
we shall shortly prove, when we proceed
to analyse his statements.</p>

<p>We have already made an approximation
to the price which, in ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
seasons, and under existing
burdens and covenants, grain ought
to bear, in order to yield a fair remuneration
to the British grower. That
price, as we have already said, has
been held to range from 54s. to 58s.
per quarter. This we hold to be a
moderate computation; but if a further
limit be desired, we shall admit&mdash;though
for argument's sake only&mdash;that
with great retrenchment and
economy, curtailing his own comforts,
but not materially reducing the wages
of the labourer, the farmer may continue
to grow wheat at an average of
50s., and nevertheless pay up his
annual rent as before. A glance at
former averages will show that this
is a remarkably low figure; and, <em>being
taken as an average</em>, it of course implies
the supposition that in some
years the price will be higher, in order
to compensate for others in which it
may be lower. Our primary business,
therefore, is to ascertain whether,
under the operation of the new system,
prices can ever rise, supposing
the present breadth of land to remain
in tillage, above this average amount;
or whether they must not permanently
diminish so much as to destroy the vestige
of an independent average in this
country, and substitute foreign growing
prices for our own. The question is a
very momentous one, for it involves
the existence of our national agriculture,
and not only that, but the existence
of the larger portion of the home
market for our manufactures, compared
with which our exports are comparatively
as nothing. It is our earnest
desire to approach it with all candour,
temper, and moderation; and we shall
not, if possible, allow ourselves to be
betrayed into a single angry word, or
discourteous expression, towards those
who have differed from us hitherto in
opinion. Neither shall we advance
or reiterate opinions upon grounds
purely theoretical. Ever since this
contest began, we have taken a decided
and consistent part, and have
not scrupled to expose, by argument,
what we held to be the glaring fallacies
of free trade. That argument,
necessarily inferential at first, has
since been borne out and corroborated
by every fact which has emerged;
and, on that account alone, we think
we are entitled to demand a serious
consideration of the matter which we
now lay before the public, as the result
of an investigation, in the course
of which no pains or trouble have
been spared, and which may help to
guide us all, be our politics what they
may, to a true sense of the danger
which must immediately arrive, if we
remain but a few months longer in a
state of fancied security. Our warning
may be derided by some, but the
day of reckoning is at hand.</p>

<p>The first point, therefore, to which
we shall entreat attention is, the prospect
of future prices; regarding which
we possess some information that
may possibly take the reader by surprise.</p>

<p>The adoption of free-trade principles,
as regards the trade in corn,
proceeded upon a false estimate of
the precise quantities available for
the supply of this country. Those
who, from various motives, combined
for the purpose of allowing the
foreigner an unrestrained competition
in the British market, had no idea of
the strength of the power which they
had thus evoked; while the fearful
and doubting protectionist, who yielded
too soon to the clamour, was little
aware of the extent of the evils which
his supineness was to bring upon him.
The statistics of the question were
altogether overlooked&mdash;at least no
proper means were taken to obtain
them in a faithful manner. The
returns made by the foreign consuls,
and the evidence collected as to the
ordinary available supplies at foreign
ports, were, in nearly every instance,
the mere reflex of the views of interested
parties, furnished to men unable,
from their habits or education,
to judge of their approach to accuracy.
The voluminous report of Mr
Jacob, which might have been of use
as a warning, at any rate, that cheap
food does not always make a happy
and comfortable people, seems to have
been forgotten in these latter days.
Hence the theories of those who had
some experience in trade, and whose
published opinions on mercantile matters
had obtained credit and celebrity,
came to be mainly relied upon.
Among these, the ideas of Mr Tooke,
whose authority stands pre-eminently
high in such matters, as to prices,
and the quantity of foreign grain which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
might, in the event of free trade, find
its way to our shores, were much
insisted on. But how far these are
erroneous and delusive has been sadly
proved by our experience of the effects
of free trade in corn since 1846.</p>

<p>Mr Tooke says, in the third volume
of his work on the <cite>History of Prices</cite>,
in the section entitled, "Conjectures
as to the Prices at which Wheat would
range, in the event of Free Trade"&mdash;which,
under ordinary circumstances,
he assumes to be 45s. per
quarter,&mdash;"The quantity which we
might look to import, at an average
of the price I have named, might approach
to from 1,500,000 to 2,000,000
of quarters." He goes on to say, "If
there were to be a fixed duty of
8s. the quarter, I very much doubt
whether the annual importation would
reach that quantity;" and afterwards
adds, "Before quitting this point,
however, I must observe that my
estimate of the price at which a
foreign supply might be expected, of
the extent supposed, may be considered
by some of the opponents of
the corn laws as strengthening the
ground for the supporters of them,
inasmuch as such statements may be
made to work upon the minds of the
farmers, in frightening them with the
prospect of cheap foreign corn."</p>

<p>What wonder, then, if the panic
has materially increased, since the
history of free trade, for the last three
years, has revealed such a fearful
addition to this estimate: for how
stands the fact? In place of 2,000,000
quarters of wheat annually, from the
passing of the Corn-Law Repeal Act
(26th June 1846) until the 5th November
1847, a period of little more than
sixteen months, we imported 7,229,916
quarters of wheat&mdash;while the total of
all kinds of grain entered for
consumption amounted to 16,331,282
quarters! Some idea may be formed
of the effects of such an augmented
importation, if we bear in mind that,
from 5th July 1828 to 1st Jan. 1841,
a period of nearly thirteen years, the
whole quantity of foreign wheat and
flour entered for home consumption
was 13,475,000 quarters.</p>

<p>But lest it should be argued that
this was a supply produced by
extraordinary circumstances, and which
could only be furnished from accumulations
of former seasons&mdash;as was,
indeed, said at the time&mdash;the further
history of the trade has shown us
that our foreign supplies continue to
pour in at precisely the same rate.
The total of all kinds of grain and
flour entered for consumption in the
last nine months, ending 5th September
1849, as exhibited by the Board
of Trade returns, shows an amount of
9,870,823 quarters, the quantity of
wheat being for this period 3,821,292
quarters; and of wheaten flour&mdash;besides
frightening the farmers, bearing
ruin to our own millers&mdash;3,236,993
cwt.&mdash;together equivalent to quarters
of wheat, 4,746,147. And all this, be
it observed, has been imported while
the average price per quarter has been
<em>one sixpence only</em> above that named as
likely to exclude the approach of more
than 1,500,000 or 2,000,000 quarters
from our shores! Formerly&mdash;in the
first years of the century, up to 1842&mdash;the
farmer had to contend against a
foreign supply of grain amounting to
little more than 1,000,000 quarters
<em>per annum</em>&mdash;now, in some cases, under
obligations contracted on the faith of
protection to native industry, he is
called upon to make the vain struggle
against an inundation of foreign corn
amounting to upwards of 1,000,000
quarters <em>per month</em>! He cannot, it
is evident, maintain the contest long.</p>

<p>Such were the facts assumed as the
basis of our legislation, and already
they stand forth to the public eye as
gross and palpable blunders. The
British agriculturist has, beyond all
question, been injured to an extent
infinitely greater than was anticipated
by any one&mdash;an extent so vast, that,
could it have been predicted as a certainty,
the rashest theorist would
have recoiled from the danger of such
an experiment.</p>

<p>But we have by no means, as yet,
attained the lowest point of depression.
At the close of the year 1849,
we take the general average price of
wheat as at 40s. per quarter, and we
shall probably have a breathing time
of two or three months, until the
Continental ports are again available
for navigation. We shall hereafter
consider whether, under any circumstances,
the price which we have just
quoted can remunerate the farmer: in
the mean time, let us see whether it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
likely that, in future, even this price
can be maintained.</p>

<p>It is no easy matter to ascertain
the rates at which corn may be grown
on the Continent. The current prices
at foreign ports, such as Hamburg,
have, in reality, little bearing upon
this most vital point, though they
have been eagerly assumed by the
free-traders as a sure index of future
prices. Very little consideration will
show every one that the true way towards
forming a fair conclusion on
the subject, is to ascertain, as nearly
as may be, the cost of grain, <em>not at the
ports from whence it issues</em>, but in the
inland countries where the greater
proportion of it is grown. The reason
for this is obvious. Under the
old system, when protective duties
were the rule, the demand for foreign
corn was exceedingly fluctuating and
uncertain. We never dealt directly
with the foreign grower; but, between
him and the British consumer, at least
three profits intervened. There were
middlemen, principally Jews, who
made it their regular business to purchase
up the superfluity of the Polish
crops on speculation, and to sell it
to the Dantzic dealers. Then came
the profit of the latter, and also that
of the British corn-merchant; and,
as the trade was notoriously a precarious
one, these profits were of
considerable amount. The demand,
however, may now be considered as
fixed and steady. Henceforward,
under the operation of free trade, the
two considerations of quality and
cheapness must alone regulate the
market. Not only the superfluity of
Continental harvests will be available,
but new land, of which there are immense
tracts of the finest description,
hitherto untilled, will be put under
cultivation, and the produce regularly
transmitted to this country, where a
ready market can at all times be found.
The first symptom of this new regular
trade will be the disappearance of one
of the intermediate profits. This is
not subject of prophecy; it has already
taken place. The foreigners have now
taken the whole of the foreign grain
trade exclusively into their own hands.
We are informed by the first corn-merchants
of Leith, that there is not
a single order sent for grain from this
country. "The finest Dantzic wheat,
free on board," writes one of our
correspondents, "will not be sold to a
British merchant for less than 38s.
the quarter; and as no more than 40s.
or 41s. could be got for it here, there
is no margin for a profit, and the risk
is not run. But the foreigner will
send it on his own account, and sell
it <em>here</em> at 38s. and realise a profit.
You thus see that the entire trade is
out of British hands, for the prices of
our own grain must entirely be ruled
by those of the foreigner; and the consequence
is, that every bushel sent to
this country is on consignment and
not to order."</p>

<p>There still remains another profit,
that of the middleman, to be reduced.
The creation of a constant and steady
demand from the foreign ports&mdash;which
demand cannot be otherwise unless a
protective law is reimposed&mdash;will
naturally excite the dealers to purchase
directly from the Polish grower.
In this way they will have double
profits, without enhancing materially,
if at all, the original cost of the grain;
for, in other Continental corn-growing
countries, untilled land may be had to
any extent for next to nothing, and
no farming capital, as we understand
the word, is required. Here a
remark or two, founded upon past history,
may be useful. About a century
and a half ago, or rather about the
time of the Revolution of 1688, the
average price of wheat, as stated by
Adam Smith, amounted to 28s. in
England. Public burdens were at
that time moderate, and so were poor-rates;
still they were of such an
amount as to be felt by the farmer.
The wages of the agricultural labourer
were at least seven shillings per week,
equal to about 10s. 6d. of our present
money, and the rent of arable
land might be estimated over-head at
5s. 6d. per acre. All these items are
enormously above the rates at present
known in the Continental corn-growing
countries, and some of them have no
existence there. It is difficult to get
at Polish charges, especially since the
late change in our policy, for we
have invariably found that foreign
proprietors are most jealous of disclosing
their true domestic position.
Nor can we wonder at this, for the
truth, were it broadly told, might
tend materially to check that liberal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sympathy, which of late years has
been so abundantly shown to the
insurgents of central Europe. We
are, however, fortunately enabled
to throw some useful light upon
this matter. Our informant is a
Scottish agriculturist, who, some years
ago, was engaged as land-steward on
the estates of a Polish nobleman in
Gallicia, and who, therefore, had
ample opportunity of witnessing the
foreign system. If the reader glances
at the map of Europe, tracing the
course of the Vistula from Dantzic,
and then following the upward line of
its tributary, the Bug, he will find laid
down in close proximity the extensive
districts of Volhynia, Podolia, Kiow,
Gallicia, and others, formerly Palatinates,
which together constitute the
largest, richest, and most productive
corn-field of Europe. Here there are
no farmers, and&mdash;what is more
strange to us&mdash;no free labourers who
receive a weekly wage. The land is
tilled for the profit of the owner; a
superintendant presides over it as
taskmaster; and the workers of the
soil are serfs in the actual position of
slaves, who toil late and early without
other remuneration than the coarse
rye bread, and similar fare, which is
necessary to support existence. The
manufactures of Manchester and Sheffield
have not found their way into
this region, and never will; because
the population, being utterly without
means, could not purchase them, and
probably would not were the means
within their power. Their dress is of
the most primitive kind, and differs
in no respect from that of tribes
utterly barbarous&mdash;being chiefly
constructed of the skins of animals.
They are hardy, docile, and exceedingly
sensitive to kindness, but as far
removed from civilisation as the tribes
of Tartary; and their owners&mdash;for
that is the proper term&mdash;take especial
care that no doctrine shall reach them
which in any way may interfere with
the exercise of despotic rule. In
short, they are like so many cattle
cultivating the land for their masters
at the bare expense of their keep. To
demonstrate more clearly the difference
of the value of labour, we may
here state, on the best authority, that
in that district where the finest wheat,
distinctively known as "high-mixed
Dantzic," is grown, the ordinary price
of a quarter of wheat will defray the
expense of from forty to forty-five
days' work, whilst here it can procure
only from twenty to twenty-five days.
The climate is excellent, and the yield
of the soil considerable. Wheat may be
grown for several years successively
without manure, and always with
comparatively little work. The produce is
floated down the numerous rivers
which intersect the district, to Dantzic
and other coast towns on the Baltic,
where it is stored; and these will in
future form the great depots of the
grain furnished by central Europe for
British consumption. Contrast this
state of matters in modern Poland
with that of England in 1688, when
land yielded a considerable rent, when
poor-rates and public burdens were
levied, and when the labouring man
received a reasonable wage; and we
must arrive at the conclusion that the
remunerating price of wheat in the
former country must be something
greatly lower than 28s. per quarter.
We are almost afraid to state our
conviction, lest it should appear exaggerated;
but we do not doubt that
Polish wheat could be delivered at
Dantzic at 16s., and yet leave a
considerable profit to the grower.
We must also note that the variableness
of our climate, and the comparative
poorness of our soil, places us at
a vast disadvantage in point of quality,
as compared with the southern grower.
It can be established, by consulting
the prices-current of Mark Lane for a
series of years, that it would require a
differential duty of 6s. per quarter on
wheat, on this account alone, to put
the British farmer on a fair footing
with the great bulk of his foreign
competitors. Last season, the difference
between the best foreign and
English wheat throughout the year,
as proved by the same authority, was
upwards of 10s. per quarter.</p>

<p>We beg it will be distinctly understood,
that, in estimating the remunerative
prices of foreign grain, we do
not profess to arrive at more than
general conclusions. It matters nothing
for or against our argument
whether wheat can be delivered at
Dantzic a little cheaper, or a little
dearer, than the above sum. We leave
room on either side for a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
margin. This much, however, we
know for a fact, that an eminent corn-merchant
in Leith has, in former years,
purchased fine wheat, free on board, at
Dantzic for 18s., with the offer of a constant
supply, and that no circumstances
have since then emerged to enhance
the cost of production. Besides this,
as Mr Sandars well remarks in one
of his published letters, we have had
plain and evident experience of foreign
production under the working
of the corn law of 1842. We had
a fixed duty of 20s. per quarter in actual
operation for four years; and in
1844 and 1845, such duty was paid,
week after week, and in the latter
year for six months consecutively, at
a time when our general averages
were only 46s. to 47s. a quarter. Was
the foreigner at that time selling at a
loss? His price, then, adapting itself
to ours, was 26s. and 27s., deducting
the duty, and at that time, be it remembered,
<em>he was unprepared for
competition</em>. So that, from experience
not five years old, we may gather
what kind of future competition awaits
us, and also what we are annually
sacrificing in revenue, by madly abandoning
protection. Does any one believe
that, in 1845, had there been
no duty on foreign corn, wheat would
have fallen to 26s., or the foreigner
have sold his crop at that price? The
remitted duty goes into the pocket of
the foreigner, who is selling in the
dearest market, and underselling our
farmers, as he will be able to do&mdash;for
he has tested that ability already&mdash;down
to a point which must extinguish
British agriculture. We know
also from Mr Meek's report, quoted by
Sir Robert Peel in 1842, that "the
prices of corn in Denmark have, during
the last twenty-five years, averaged,
for wheat, 28s. 10d., rye, 19s.
9d., barley, 14s., and oats, 10s. 6d.
per quarter," and it is obviously ridiculous
to suppose that the cost of production
in Poland is nearly so high as
in Denmark and Schleswig-Holstein.
Last year Denmark sent us upwards of
a million quarters of grain. These are
facts which have distinctly emerged,
and they are all-important at the
present time, when the tenantry are
urged to expend further capital on the
chance of future rise of prices. It is
now perfectly clear that the returns,
which were assumed as the basis for
the great experiment, are worthy of
no confidence. On the other hand,
we do not wish that our opinions,
which point to a totally different result,
should influence any one in his
future line of conduct; but, beyond
our opinions, there are certain facts,
which we have just stated, and the
import of which cannot be misunderstood,
and these may serve as warnings
for the future. Of the capability of
the foreigner to supply us with any
given amount of grain, we think no
reasonable man can doubt. There is
a breadth of soil open sufficient to supply
more than twenty times the most
exorbitant demand. It is his power
to undersell us, and the extent of
that power, which have been questioned;
and on the solution of that question
depends the utility of high farming,
in this country, on a grand and
comprehensive scale. We shall show
that, at present prices, high farming
is so far from remunerative, that those
who practise it are actually incurring
an immense loss; and that, unless
rents come down to zero, or at least
to a point which would utterly ruin
the landlords, high farming cannot be
proceeded with. We have shown
that, within the last five years, we
have been supplied, and that regularly,
from abroad, when wheat was
at 46s. per quarter, and a duty of
20s. existed; and, at such rates,
it is quite evident that all attempt
at competition would be hopeless.
Wheat could not be grown remuneratively
at 26s. or 27s. in England
before a single shilling of the national
debt was incurred; and no man is
mad enough to insist upon its possibility
now. When, therefore, the
Free-traders tell us that the present is
a mere temporary depreciation, we
ask them&mdash;and we demand a distinct
reply&mdash;for an explanation of the imports
in 1845. How was it that, for
a long period, foreign corn came in
plentifully, paying the duty of 20s.,
when our home averages were at
46s. and 47s.? Can they assign any
special reason for it? If not, the conclusion
is plain, that the foreign
growers can and will undersell us
down to that point, if we possibly
could compete with them so far, and
all the while add to their profit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
while they also abstract from our
revenue.</p>

<p>Our belief, as we have said already,
is, that the foreigner could afford to
go much lower, and that he could furnish
us with wheat at little more than
18s. We have stated above an instance
of this kind, and, if necessary,
we could furnish more. Nor will the
statement appear exaggerated to
those who will take the trouble of
comparing English prices and English
burdens, as they existed before
the Revolution of 1688, with the
prices and rates of the great corn-growing
countries of central Europe
at the present moment, making due
allowance for climate and the difference
of social institutions. At the
same time, let it be understood that we
do not aver, that all the foreign grain
which way find its way here can be
grown at such low prices. Pomeranian
and Bohemian wheat is more
expensive in culture than that of
Poland; and we know that there is
some difference between Hamburg
and Dantzic prices. Still our conviction
is most decided, that henceforward
the foreigner has the game
entirely in his hands; that he may
prescribe what price he pleases to this
country; and that every year, in spite
of all efforts, all home harvests, all
variety of seasons, prices must inevitably
decline. If it were possible that,
by high farming, or any other means,
we could produce wheat remuneratively
at 30s., or 25s., the foreigner
would be ready to sell in competition
at 25s. or 18s., even supposing he
received hardly any profit. His business
is <em>to get hold of the British
market</em>, and that once accomplished,
he may elevate or depress prices as he
pleases. The declension will be gradual,
but it will be perfectly steady.
This year wheat has been brought
down to 40s., not in consequence of an
exuberant harvest, as in 1835, but
through competition. A million of
quarters per month have been poured
in to sink prices, and we are now debating
at home whether British agriculture
can go on under such circumstances.
Tenants are mourning over
their losses; labourers are feeling the
pinch of lowered wages; some landlords,
in apprehension of diminished rents, are
exhorting to further outlay of capital;
statesmen are consulting with chemists;
and agitators, who have made all the
ruin, are shouting for financial reductions.
In the mean time, the winter is
crawling on apace. The price of grain
in Britain has been beat down by competition
<em>with a poor foreign crop</em>, for
such unquestionably was the yield
of 1848. That of 1849 was a splendid
one, and, the moment the ports are
opened in spring, its influence will be
felt. The question will not then be
of 40s, but of a price still lower; and
we apprehend that, in that event, the
argument will be nearly closed. We
do not, however, anticipate that the
reduction will be rapid. The dealers
at the different foreign ports will best
consult their own interest by keeping,
as nearly as possible, just below
the quotations current in the British
market. In this way large profits will
be secured during the whole
maintenance of the struggle, which
must end by the British farmer,
overloaded with rent, taxes, and
public burdens, giving way to his competitors,
who, with no such impediments,
and with a better climate and
richer soil, will monopolise his proper
function. We shall then experience
in corn, what our West Indian colonists,
under the same kind of legislation, have
experienced in sugar. The greater part
of the soil of Britain will be diverted
from cereal growth; and, as the earth
does not yield her produce without
long wooing, we shall be at the mercy
of the foreigner for our supplies of
food, at any rates which he may
choose to impose.</p>

<p>As to the matter of freights, about
which so much was at one time said
and written, we need not complicate
the question by entering into minute
details. From information upon which
we can rely, we learn that, at this
moment, steamers are constructing for
the sole purpose of effecting rapid and
continual transit between foreign and
British ports, for the conveyance of
grain&mdash;a circumstance which speaks
volumes as to the anticipations of the
Continental traders. We may also
observe that ordinary freights form no
bar to importation, since they are
now hardly greater from the Baltic to
this country than from Ross-shire to
Leith, or from many parts of England
to London. One fact, communicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
by a correspondent connected with the
shipping trade, has peculiarly impressed
us. We give it in his own
words: "I enclose you a price-current,
which will give you the prices of all
grain. Grain from America has lately
come home, both in American and
British ships, at 4d. per bushel freight,
and flour at 6d. per barrel&mdash;but
much more frequently shipped on the
condition <em>that, if it leaves a profit, the
one half goes to the shipper, and the
other half to the owner of the ship for
freight</em>." He adds, "The freights from
Quebec and Montreal are higher&mdash;say
2s. 6d. or 3s. for flour; but as
British shipping ceases being protected
after 1st January, they will be equally
low there." So much for pulling down
one interest by way of compensation
to another!</p>

<p>The reader&mdash;or rather the critical
economist&mdash;may treat the foregoing
remarks as speculative or not, according
to the colour of his opinions. All
the discussion upon free-trade has
been speculative, and so was the
legislation also. We take credit for
having anticipated what we now see
realised; but beyond that, and beyond
the facts which the experience of former
years has given us, and which we
have just laid before our readers, we are,
as a matter of course, open to objection,
and also liable to error. We have
not been arguing, however, without
sound data&mdash;such as, we suspect, never
were brought fully under the eye of
our statesmen&mdash;and they all tend
manifestly and clearly to the same
conclusion. That conclusion is, that,
without the reimposition of a protective
duty, prices cannot rise above
the present level. Our argument
goes further; for we hold it to be clear
that, without some extraordinary
combination of circumstances which
we cannot conceive, prices must decline,
and decline greatly. We look
for nothing else; but having had our
say as to the future, and pointed out the
prospect before us, we shall now confine
ourselves to present circumstances,
and endeavour to ascertain whether,
with a continuance of <em>present prices</em>,
and under existing burdens, agriculture
can be carried on in Britain at a
reasonable profit to the farmer.</p>

<p>Mr Caird's pamphlet, though it has
attracted a good deal of attention,
contains no hints or information which
are new to the practical farmer. Its
high-sounding title would lead us to
suppose that he had discovered some
improved system of agriculture, which
might be applicable throughout the
kingdom. We read the pamphlet;
and we find that it contains nothing
beyond the description of a very low-rented
and peculiarly-situated farm,
the occupant of which appears to have
realised considerable profits from an
extensive cultivation of the potato.
It is not necessary that we should do
more than allude to the general tone of
the pamphlet, which seems to us rather
more arrogant than the occasion demanded.
Mr Caird, we doubt not, is
a good practical farmer; but we should
very much have preferred a distinct
and detailed statement of his own
experiences at Baldoon, to an incomplete
and unattested account of his
neighbour's doings at Auchness. A
man is fairly entitled to lecture to his
class when he can show that, in his
own person, he is a thorough master
of his subject. A farmer who has
devised improvements, tested them,
and found them to answer his expectations,
and to repay him, has a right
to take high ground, and to twit his
brother tenants with their want of
skill or energy. But Mr Caird is not
in this position. He is occupier of a
farm of considerable extent, but he
does not venture to give us the results
of his own experience. It is possible
that he may himself pursue the system
which he advocates, but he does not
tell us so; he points to Mr M'Culloch
as the model. This is at best
but secondary evidence; howbeit we
shall take it as it comes; and as this
is strictly a farmer's question, it may
be best to allow one practical agriculturist
to reply to the views of another.
We might, indeed, have abstained
altogether from doing so, for Mr
Monro of Allan, in a very able pamphlet,
entitled <cite>Landlords' Rents and
Tenants' Profits</cite>, has distinctly and
unanswerably exposed the fallacies of
Mr Caird. Still, lest it should be
said that we are disposed to reject,
too lightly, any evidence which has
been adduced on the opposite side,
we have requested Mr Stephens,
author of <cite>The Book of the Farm</cite>, to
favour us with his views as to Auchness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
cultivation. We subjoin them,
for the benefit of all concerned.</p>

<p>"On perusing Mr Caird's pamphlet,
every practical man must be struck
with astonishment at the inordinate
quantity of potatoes cultivated at
Auchness.</p>

<p>"The entire thirty acres of dried
moss, (p. 7,) and twenty-five acres of
lea, (p. 15,) were in potatoes in 1848;
and the county Down farmer, whose
statement is reprinted at the close of
Lord Kinnaird's pamphlet, reports
that the number of acres occupied by
potatoes in 1849 was ninety. This is
more than one-third of the whole area
of the land. I have considered attentively
the calculation made by the
farmer; and I think that, in order to
meet present prices, it should be
modified as below. You will also
observe that, in my opinion, the outlay
on the farm has been too highly
estimated.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>"This balance sheet shows a profit of
£931; but as the potatoes are worth
£1350, which is no less than £419 more
than all the profit, it is evident that it
is the potato <em>alone</em> that affords any
profit under this instance of high
farming. Indeed Mr Caird admits
as much when he says, 'The <em>great</em> value
of a sound potato crop induces
the tenant to adopt such means as
will not interfere with the <em>continued</em>
cultivation of this root.' The admission
is, that the profit rests entirely
on the precarious potato. The potato
has hitherto been safe in the moss of
Auchness, and it is safe there in no
other class of soil. In Ireland, even
the moss does not save it. There is no
high farming in the matter, in so far
as manures are concerned, for as much
and richer manure is used in the
neighbourhood of large towns; and as
on the moss at Auchness too much
manure may be applied, at least after
a certain time, so there may be on
other soils; and thus high farming,
in reference to soils, just means
heavy manuring. Mr Caird says,
'The potato has been grown on the
moss land successively, year after
year; but the entire reclaimed portions,
<em>from being so frequently manured</em>,
are becoming too rich, and the
crop beginning to show signs of disease,
and a tendency to grow to tops
rather than roots, which makes it necessary
to adopt some plan of reducing
its fertility.' It is known to every
farmer, that it is quite possible to
overmanure any crop, and the effects
of overmanuring are, the breaking
down of the straw of the grain crops,
and the hollowing of the core of the
tubers and bulbs of the green crops.
The inference then is, that a profit
which depends entirely on potatoes is
uncertain in any year; and the particular
case of Auchness, in which
that profit is derived from moss, is
not generally applicable to the country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and cannot, therefore, be held up
as an example to farmers.</p>

<p>"The farm of Auchness contains
nothing remarkable: for although the
peculiar culture of the potato in moss
is generally inapplicable, there are
many farms in Scotland which have
moss attached to them. The sea-ware
may also be got on most farms on the
coast, and where this is the case, it is
commonly used. The soil is not good,
and is certainly below the average
quality; but I cannot understand
what is meant by Mr Caird, when he
asserts, on p. 7, that the '125 acres
of light sandy soil is better adapted
for <em>wheat</em> than for barley or oats when
in a high state of cultivation,' for, in
other parts of the country, such a soil
would be eminently suited for barley.
The steading is large for the size of
the farm, but every steading ought to
be made conformable to the farm by
the landlord. The system of farming
followed by Mr M'Culloch, of having
'no fixed rotation of crops,' is highly
objectionable, and Mr Caird, with
great propriety, does not commend it;
since the farmer who manages so, has
no dependence on the amount of crop
he may receive any year, and must
work according to circumstances, and
not on principle, as the unhappy Irish
hitherto have done. In this respect,
also, Auchness is no example for the
country; and, were a regular rotation
followed on it, so many potatoes could
not be grown, and the profits would
be proportionally reduced.</p>

<p>"On the whole, then, I would say
that Auchness farming is not generally
applicable; and therefore it is useless
to proclaim it as an antidote to free
competition. For although it is probably
true, as Mr Caird says, 'that
<em>green</em> crops are likely henceforth to be
the main stay of the agriculturists of
this country,' yet he must be conscious
that he is wrong in recommending, as
an example, and as a substitute for
protection, the <em>enlarged</em> cultivation of
<em>potatoes</em> as a green crop, seeing that
their growth has, of late years, been
attended with great uncertainty. Is
it not a mockery, then, to tell us that
our main stay against foreign competition
should depend upon a peculiarly
uncertain crop? Will his pointing
to a moss of 30 acres in Wigtonshire,
convince the farmers of this
great kingdom, that their future safety,
as a class, must entirely depend upon
their cultivating such a root on such
a soil, in preference to wheat on the
fertile loams of glorious old England?
I apprehend that such a result is
beyond the power of argument."</p>

<p>The non-agricultural reader must
pardon us for the insertion of these
details. They are necessary for our
case, because, if high farming can be
made an efficient substitute for protection,
we are bound to adopt it, and we
should owe a deep debt of gratitude to
any one who could point out the way.
We are fully alive to the necessity of
agricultural enterprise; and, if we
thought that our farmers were standing
beside their mired waggon, clamorously
invoking the assistance of Jupiter,
when they should be clapping their
own shoulders to the wheel, we would
be the first to remonstrate on the
heinous folly of their conduct. It is
because <em>no amount</em> of personal exertion
has been spared, that we seek to
enforce their claim according to the
utmost of our ability; and, in doing
so, we are bound to prove, that no
ordinary means which have been suggested
for their extrication can be of
the smallest avail. Mr Caird has
come forward in the character of
adviser, and we have stated the
opinion of practical men as to the
feasibility of his scheme. We have
yet more to state, for nature has
already denounced his plan far more
effectually than opinion. When the
county Down farmer visited Auchness
in July last, he found more than
one-third of the whole farm under
potato culture. Upon that crop depended
not only the whole profits,
but a great deal more. Without the
potatoes, there would have been a
loss, at a more favourable calculation
than his, of £419, on a farm paying
only £262 of rent. <em>Since then</em>, we
are informed on the best authority,
<em>that disease has attacked the potatoes</em>.
The highly-manured moss could not
preserve from decay, if it did not accelerate
it, the uncertain and precarious
root. Mr Caird must not quarrel
with the penalty he has incurred for
having totally misunderstood the
nature of the question which is now
agitating the public mind. Whilst
all others were directing their attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to cereal produce, he kept his
eyes obstinately fixed on a little
patch of ground which seemed to
give unusual facilities for the growth
of the doubtful potato. He never
attempted to show that, without
potatoes, and an exorbitant growth
of that vegetable, high farming could
pay at Auchness, even with the important
elements of very low rent,
and singular liberality on the part of
an enthusiastic landlord. He perilled
his whole case upon the probable returns
of a root which every farmer
views with suspicion; and&mdash;more than
that&mdash;his statistics, which he wished
to be inferred were of universal application,
were only applicable to a few
remote and isolated spots in Scotland.
The result is, that, with all
these advantages, the experiment
has failed; and that all the liquid
manures, economy of dung, guano
stimulants, and so forth, as practised
at Auchness, cannot, at present prices
of produce, force up so much grain,
or feed so much stock, as will nearly
pay for the required and inevitable
expenses. We pass over all possible
mistakes. It may have been matter
of delicacy for Mr Caird to have
exposed the balance-sheet of his
neighbour, or he may have assumed,
rather hastily, statistics for which he
had meagre warrant. We can allow
him a large margin. <em>Without</em>
potatoes, and such an extent of
potato as would be plainly ludicrous if
adopted as a general rule, Auchness
never could have paid. <em>With</em> potatoes,
it has failed in the very year wherein
Mr Caird has chosen to exhibit it as
a universal model.</p>

<p>So much for the only instance of
high farming which has been adduced,
as an example of its efficacy in
superseding the protective system.
In justice to Mr M'Culloch, whom
we believe to be a most intelligent
farmer, let it not be thought that we
presume to call it empirical. On the
contrary, we are convinced that that
gentleman has acted with great judgment,
suiting his management to the
nature of the ground with which he
had to deal; and that he has made
as much of it as any man could do
under similar circumstances. He was
compelled to deal with a precarious
crop, and few men could have dealt
with it better: still, his method is no
example to others differently situated,
nor are his results to be taken by
them either as matter of warning or
of triumph. It is sufficient for us that
Auchness farming, successful or not,
is peculiar, and cannot be dragged in
as a rule or example for the English
or the Scottish farmer. We have
enough of high farming statistics to
lay before our readers, and, therefore,
without any further apology, we dismiss
the matter of Auchness, as
totally inapplicable to the great question
at issue.</p>

<p>In order to arrive as nearly as possible
at the true state of the case, in
so far as Scottish farming is concerned,
we put ourselves into communication
with two gentlemen, of the highest
eminence in their profession. We
need scarcely tell our countrymen on
this side of the Border, that it would
be difficult to find better testimony on
such a subject than that of Messrs
Watson of Keillor, and Dudgeon of
Spylaw; and we apprehend, moreover,
that many English agriculturists
are fully acquainted with their character
and high reputation. Through
their kindness we have been furnished
with the statistics of farms situated in
the fertile grain-growing districts of
Forfar and Roxburgh; and the calculations
as to the yield, prices, and
expenses, were made from their own
books. The rent set down is that
which is usual in the district for land
of the best description, and the tenant's
capital is named at an amount which
might enable him to develop the full
capabilities of the soil. The estimates
have been most carefully framed, with
the view of avoiding every kind of
exaggeration; and they have been
gone over by Mr Stephens, who attests
their general accuracy. They are as

<p class="sig">

"<span class="smcap">Edinburgh</span>, <em>8th December 1849</em>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Wishing to publish in our Magazine as accurate a statement as we could
obtain of the real condition and prospects of agriculture in Scotland at present, we
have for some time been engaged in correspondence on the subject with various
gentlemen connected with agricultural pursuits.</p>

<p>"The enclosed statements of the working of a farm, and the quantity and value at
present prices of the produce, have been drawn out by Mr Watson, Keillor, Forfarshire,
and Mr Dudgeon, Spylaw, near Kelso, assisted by Mr Stephens, author of the
"Book of the Farm."</p>

<p>"At the suggestion of Mr &mdash;&mdash; we write to ask whether you will consent
to allow us to affix your name to these statements, as attesting their accuracy, to the
best of your experience, in farming. If it strikes you that in any of these statements
the profits are either over or under estimated, we shall feel greatly obliged by your
pointing out where you think the error lies. Any correction you may make we shall
submit to the consideration of one or all of the above-mentioned gentlemen, with
whose names, as competent judges of the working of a farm, you are probably
acquainted.</p>

<p>"We shall feel further obliged by your making any remarks that may occur to you,
and stating any facts that have come within your own observation, our only wish
being to get as near the truth as may be. The article in the Magazine, into which this
attested statement will be introduced, is founded upon the facts that we have been able
to gather in the course of somewhat extended inquiries by ourselves, or rather by
friends on whose knowledge of agriculture we could safely rely.</p>

<p>"Will you be so good as to send any answer you may think proper to this application,
within a week from this date, or sooner if you can, as we have very little time to
get everything into order for publication in the January number of our Magazine.&mdash;We
are," &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>We further subjoin extracts from
the letters of several of these gentlemen,
containing remarks or suggestions
about the statements:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was favoured with your letter and enclosure of the 8th inst. I have gone
carefully over the statements of the working of a farm, and the quantity and value,
at present prices, of the produce&mdash;all of which appear to me to be fairly stated. I
have drawn up a statement of the returns of produce of a 400 acre farm in Mid-Lothian,
which, if it meets your approval, you are at liberty to publish along with
the others. The prices of the grain which I have assumed are in some instances
higher than those of Messrs Dudgeon and Watson; but I think this can be explained,
by the farm being situated in the neighbourhood of the best market."&mdash;(<small>THOMAS SADLER</small>,
Norton Mains, Ratho.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"I am in receipt of your letter of the 8th current, inclosing statements by various
eminent agriculturists, showing the difference between times past and to come for
farmers. I perfectly coincide with these gentlemen; and consider their valuation of
produce and price to be average and just: although we are not at present realising
the prices quoted, yet it is fair that an allowance should be made this year for the full
crop wheat."&mdash;(<small>ANDREW HOWDEN</small>, Lawhead, Prestonkirk.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"On looking over the statements you handed me of the comparative value of farm
produce, under protection and free-trade prices, as drawn up by Messrs Watson and
Dudgeon, my first impression was, that they had fixed the protection price of grain
too high; but on taking the average prices of my own sales of the different kinds of
grain, as entered in my corn-book, from crop 1827 to that of 1845, I find they are not
beyond what I have actually received during that period. The only points in which
I differ from these gentlemen's statements are in the rents fixed by them for land
yielding the crops they mention, which in my opinion should not be less than 35s. per
acre, and £1000 might be taken from the sum put down as necessary for floating
capital by Mr Watson; and I think, upon an average of years, that £50 should cover
the loss of live stock. These alterations I have suggested would make no material
change in the calculations, which, in the main particulars, I hold to be perfectly correct."&mdash;(<small>ROBERT
NISBET</small>, Lambden, Greenlaw.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have to acknowledge the receipt of your agricultural statements, and have carefully
examined them, especially Mr Dudgeon's, as being the one with which I am
best acquainted. I have tested its various items, and have found them generally correct,
and in agreement with my own practical experience. There is one, however,
which I consider too low&mdash;viz., the allowance of barley for seed and servants. Mr
Dudgeon, I believe, uses a drill-sowing machine, and, by that means, will save about
one bushel of seed per acre; but as this mode of sowing has not come into general
use, the following is what is commonly found necessary&mdash;</p>


<div class="center">

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right">246</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>From the general accuracy of the statement, I have no hesitation in consenting to
the use of my name in connexion with it."&mdash;(<small>WILLIAM BROAD</small>, Clifton Hill, Kelso.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"Having for several years farmed land in the vicinity of Kelso, and of a description
somewhat similar to that described by Mr Dudgeon, Spylaw, I beg to say that I agree
essentially with the statement subscribed by him. It exhibits, in my opinion, a fair
estimate of the returns of such a farm when in good condition, and of the necessary
expenses attending the working and keeping it in good order. In many cases, a
much larger sum has been expended in improvements, but that would probably make
no great difference in the result; for while the occupier would have a larger sunk
capital to draw out of the land, he would probably have a smaller rent to pay. I
may remark, that even where land has been thoroughly drained, or does not require
it, there is usually a large sum sunk at the commencement of a lease in liming, for I
consider that almost all land in this district would require to be limed during the
currency of a lease, in order to yield full crops."&mdash;(<small>FRED. L. ROY</small>, Nenthorn, Kelso.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"I think Mr Dudgeon makes too little allowance for stock and insurance, (£50.)
Mr Watson's allows double, (£100,) which is low enough. Some of my neighbours
here have lost from £200 to £300 by pleuro-pneumonia upon cattle alone, independent
of other stock. I also think they are both wrong in the average quantity of grain
grown. It may be done upon a farm of good land, in high condition, but&mdash;I mean
taking a whole county&mdash;it is, I think, above the mark. For example, 1836, 1837,
1838, 1839, 1840, 1841, being six years running, with as fine appearance of wheat as I
ever grew, I did not average twenty-six bushels per acre, weighing 64 lb. to 65 lb.
per imperial bushel, in these six years. I considered my loss equal to 2000 bolls wheat
below a fair crop, all in consequence of the fly."&mdash;(<small>JOHN THOMPSON</small>, Craigie, Leuchars.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have carefully looked over Mr Watson's statement, and I think that his calculations
are very correct, and agree entirely with my experience, except in regard
to the profits upon stock, which I think he has rather overrated, as the price of stock
is falling every week. I do not think it necessary, however, to make out a separate
statement."&mdash;(<span class="smcap">David Hood</span>, Hatton, Glammis.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"In reply to yours of the 8th instant, requesting my opinion as to the accuracy of
the statements in your enclosed proof-sheet, I have to state that, after mature consideration,
I generally concur with the statement drawn by Mr Watson as to the
results; though, I think, that as a deduction of £20 per cent on the profits of livestock
has been made in the free-trade account, a like percentage should be deducted
from the amount stated for casualties in the charge, thus making the loss under free
trade £20 less. It also appears to me, that both the capital invested, and the amount
received for crop and stock, are considerably beyond the average of farming capital
and proceeds in Strathmore and the eastern district of Forfarshire; but as the statement
is headed as "under the improved system of agriculture," of course the amounts
must be different, and therefore are acceded to.</p>

<p>"It may be remarked, that the depreciation of £20 per cent on the value of livestock,
which has taken place this year, ought only to be deducted from the average
of the last ten or twelve years, as the present prices might be considered equal to what
we had been receiving previously to the opening up the southern markets.</p>

<p>"In my own case, the rent is considerably lower than that assumed, as I occupy
a large proportion of unequal, inferior soil, which I have drained at my own expense;
and, in order to raise the same quantity of grain per acre as mentioned in the statement,
I have hitherto had to pay at least £100 more for manure than what seems to
be allowed for under the title 'expenses of management.'"&mdash;(<span class="smcap">William Ruxton</span>,
Farnell, Brechin.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"I received yours of the 8th, with the enclosed statements regarding the prospects
of agriculture, and as this was a ploughing-match day, (the Buchan district,) I deferred
writing you until I should also show it to several experienced farmers for their
opinions, and we all consider the statements as near as may be correct."&mdash;(<span class="smcap">John
Hutchison</span>, Monyruy, Peterhead.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have examined minutely the statements drawn up by Messrs Watson and
Dudgeon, and have compared them with some calculations that I had previously made
myself, and have no hesitation in allowing my name to be affixed to them as attesting
their accuracy, in so far as my knowledge of the localities in which they are drawn up
leads me to be a judge. Had I had time, I should have liked to have furnished you
with a similar comparative statement of the difference likely to be made by free trade
in our more northern climate, where we cannot raise the same quality of grain, and
where little or no wheat is grown, <em>and I am much afraid it would not have been so
favourable to farmers</em> as Messrs Watson and Dudgeon's are. The average price of
what has been sold of this year's crop, in the counties of Aberdeen and Banff, is not
more, I am sure, than 1s. 8d. per bushel for oats, and 2s. 6d. for bear or barley."&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Robert
Simpson</span>, Cobairdy, Huntly.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"As to the statements of Messrs Watson and Dudgeon, the items appear to me, on
the whole, to be fairly put. My only difficulty is in regard to the £3000 put down
in Mr Watson's statement as invested capital. I presume, however, he includes in
this draining and lime sunk, machinery, implements, horses, &amp;c.; and, considering the
valuable breed of cattle and sheep on the Keillor Farm, I would not regard £5000
as at all too large an estimate for capital of both kinds. As to the considerable
difference in profits shown in Nos. I. and II., that might be accounted for in many
ways. In 500-acre farms, with equal management and a like rent, greater differences
will be induced by variations in the soil and climate alone.</p>

<p>"On the presumption above stated, as to what Mr Watson means by invested capital,
I have no difficulty in allowing you to affix my name, as attesting, to the best of my
knowledge, the substantial accuracy of statements Nos. I. and II."&mdash;(<span class="smcap">William
M'Combie</span>, Tillyfour, Aberdeen.)</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>"I have gone over the respective statements with much care and anxiety, and have
compared the different items entered to the debit and credit of the farm by both gentlemen
with my own experience in such matters, and, on the whole, I have no hesitation
in pronouncing them as nearly correct as, under the circumstances, they could be
framed. Were I to draw up a statement of a farm of the like extent in this county,
I believe the result would be still <em>less favourable</em> for the farmer, because if we have
such returns as are stated by Messrs Watson and Dudgeon, we obtain them by the
application to our land of a larger quantity of foreign manure than those gentlemen
seem to use."&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Peter Brown</span>, Linkwood, Elgin.)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the gentlemen to whom we
wrote, whilst entirely concurring in
the estimates of Messrs Watson and
Dudgeon, have not authorised us to
affix their names. Only three gentlemen,
out of nearly fifty, have refused
their assent on the ground of difference
of opinion. The most important objection
specified by any of them was,
that the prices of grain assumed in
No. II., as having been received
before protection was withdrawn,
were <em>higher</em> than those warranted by
the fiars' prices of the county. Such
were, however, the actual prices received
in those years by Mr Dudgeon;
and the reader is requested to refer to
the extract from Mr Nisbet of Lambden's
letter for a corroboration as to
that point. That there should be
some difference of opinion is only
natural, when the variations of soil,
climate, and locality are considered;
but we think it will generally be admitted,
that the ordeal to which these

<p>I consider the above a fair statement of the expenditure and income on a
farm in the lower district of Aberdeenshire, under former and under present
circumstances. It will be observed that no wheat is grown; but the soil is
well adapted for the rearing and feeding of cattle, and from this source the
Aberdeenshire farmer expects to derive a large proportion of his returns. In
the comparison, reference is had solely to the fall in the price of the kinds
of grain cultivated. Whatever decline in the price of fat cattle may arise
from free trade, will fall heavily on the farmers of this district; and the reduction
of income thus occasioned will, of course, add to the amount of loss
shown above.</p>

JAMES HAY,<br />
<span class="smcap">Little Ythsie</span>, <em>13th December 1849.</em>
</p>

<p>Having lately had an opportunity of examining a number of <em>actual</em> accounts
of income and expenditure on various farms, I can confirm the substantial
accuracy and fairness of the above statements, Nos. I. and II. Mr Hay's
statement above, referring to the system of agriculture with which, in this part
of the country, we are most conversant, may, in my humble opinion, be
regarded as fair and just, and as near the average that a comparison of a
number of individual cases would indicate, as it can be made.</p>

<p>I am sensible that, in many cases of calculations&mdash;more especially in those
in which certain assumptions have to be made&mdash;it is quite possible, even with
a show of fairness, to bring out by means of figures almost any result that
may be desired; but it is to be observed that, in the above statements, the
<em>same</em> assumptions (if they can be regarded as such) are made on both sides of
the comparison, with the exception of the prices at which agricultural produce
is taken; and it is submitted with confidence that these are neither made
higher in the one case, nor lower in the other, than experience warrants.</p>

<p>The total amount of capital invested is £4500, of which £2500 is sunk upon
improvements. According to the first estimate, the annual return, exclusive
of 5 per cent per annum for repayment of the sum sunk, would be £548, or
at the rate of about 12<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>5</small></sub> per cent. According to the second estimate, the
annual return would be £45, 10s., or at the rate of about 1 per cent per
annum upon the same sum.</p>

<p>I shall be glad to allow my name to be affixed to Mr Dudgeon's statement,
as attesting, in so far as my experience goes, the accuracy of it.</p>

<p>My estimates and his very nearly correspond; but as every one has his own
method of making up such statements, I take the liberty of handing along with
it this detail of my own.</p>

<p>In all, excepting in regard to the value of live stock, or produce of grass
and turnips, we nearly agree; and this difference may be accounted for, because
no part of farm produce varies so much in its return as that of the live
stock. Upon such a farm as that which is taken as an example, sheep and
cattle are not wholly reared upon the farm, but part are bought in to fatten;
hence the returns depend upon three circumstances,&mdash;1st, upon the crops of
turnips and grass being less or more abundant; 2d, upon the price of lean stock;
and, 3d, upon the price of fat. While, therefore, the butcher market may be
very high, the feeder may not necessarily be well paid,&mdash;and hence, in making
up returns under this head, a correct average is not easily ascertained; and as
there must always be a difference of opinion among practical men upon this
part of the subject, I think, for publication, Mr Dudgeon's method of stating
the returns <em>in one sum</em> is preferable to giving them in detail.</p>

Scots acres, situated within five miles of Edinburgh, on an average of
seven years previous to potato failure in 1846, and farmed according to
the four-shift rotation, the straw being sold in Edinburgh, and dung
bought. The produce is a fair average of the best-managed farms within
five miles of Edinburgh, during the period from which the average is taken.
The prices noted are what were realised, being about 3s. 6d. per qr.
above the average prices of the county, and the expense of management
charged is what was actually paid.</p>

<p>[We ought, perhaps, to explain that
this case is peculiar. It is that of a
first-class farm in the neighbourhood
of Edinburgh, attested by men of the
same standing as its tenant, and similarly
situated; the average of the
produce is very high, and the rent
corresponding. Mr Gibson, the tenant
farmer, has taken the details of the
following statement from his books; so
that it becomes of much value, as
showing the statistics of farming in
the immediate vicinity of the metropolis
of Scotland. In estimating the
productiveness of this farm by the
extent of the yield, our English
readers must bear in mind, that it is
divided by the Scots and not the imperial
acre as in the other estimates, the
former being one-fifth larger. It will
be allowed, on all hands, that the
yield of this farm is extraordinary.]</p>

1849: as the Wheat crop is considered to be the best we have had in the
district since 1835, every allowance is made for this in estimating the produce.
The Oat, Barley, and Bean crops are under an average, but are charged at
average quantities; the prices noted are what are being realised. In the expense
of management full allowance is made in every item affected by present prices,
except the seed, which is charged as paid for at seed time: had it been charged
at present prices, there would fall to be deducted from expense of management
a sum of £28.</p>

<p>Let those who believe that, by high
farming, the soil can be stimulated so
as to produce enormously augmented
crops, at a large additional profit,
consider the above statistics well.
<span class="smcap">They are the statistics of the
very highest farming in Scotland.</span>
The English agriculturist has
been taunted for his backwardness
in not adopting the improvements of
his northern neighbour, who, with a
worse climate, has made the most of
the soil. Such has been the language
used by some of the advocates and
apologists of free trade, who are now
urging the farmer to lay out more
capital in draining and manures&mdash;assuring
him that, by doing so, the returns
will far exceed the interest of
the outlay. With a fine disregard for
the elements of arithmetic, they insist
that low prices can in no way interfere
with his success, and that only
exertion and enterprise are wanting
to raise him above the reach of foreign
competition. The above tables exhibit
the experiment, worked out to its
highest point. In these cases capital
has been liberally expended, energy
tasked to the utmost, and every means,
which science can devise or experience
suggest, called into active operation.
The farmers of Mid-Lothian,
Berwickshire and Forfarshire may
fairly challenge the world in point of
professional attainments. They have
done all that man can do, and here is
the reward of their toil.</p>

<p>Supposing, then, that hereafter the
permanent price of wheat were to be
40s. a quarter; that other cereal produce
remained at corresponding rates;
and that the value of live stock did
not diminish&mdash;points, upon all of
which we are truly more than sceptical&mdash;it
will follow that high farming,
such as is at present practised in the
best agricultural districts of Scotland,
cannot by possibility be carried on.
No possible reduction of rent would
suffice to enable the farmer to continue
his competition. Such a fall must
necessarily have the effect of annihilating
one of the two classes; for the
landlord, burdened as he is, would
cease to draw the means of maintenance
from his estate, and it is
questionable whether the residue
would suffice to pay the interest of
the mortgages and preferable burdens.
To the people of Scotland this is the
most vital question that has engaged
their attention since the Union. Our
national prosperity does not depend
upon manufactures to the same degree
as that of England. By far the
greater portion of our wealth arises
directly from the soil: by far the
larger number of our population depend
upon that for their subsistence.
Even if Manchester statistics were
applicable to England, the case is
different here. If the prices of agricultural
produce should continue as
low as at present&mdash;and we cannot see
what chance exists of their rising, in
the face of such a tremendous import&mdash;the
effect upon this country must be
disastrous. Such prices would reduce
Scotland, at one fell swoop, to the
condition of Ireland: paralyse the
home market for manufactures; throw
hundreds of thousands out of employment;
lower the revenue; augment
the poor-rates; and utterly disorganise
society. And yet what help for
it? The farmer cannot be expected to
pay for the privilege of losing several
hundreds per annum by cultivation.
Let Mr Watson's statement be examined,
and it will appear that the enterprising
and skilful tenant of a farm
of five hundred acres, in the best corn
district of Forfar, cannot clear his expenses
unless the rent of the land is
reduced by one-half, and, even if that
were done, he could only realise a
profit of sixpence per acre! Such a
result, we fairly allow, would appear,
at first sight, to be incredible; yet there
it is&mdash;vouched for by men of name,
character, and high reputation. This
is the extreme case; but, if we pass to
Berwickshire, we shall find that a
reduction of half the rent would barely
place the tenant in the same position
which he occupied previous to the
withdrawal of protection. Look at
No. IV., and the result will appear
worse. Even were one half of the
rent remitted, the profits of the tenants,
at present prices, would be less
by £100 than they were at the former
rates of corn. Very nearly the same
results will be brought out, if we calculate
the necessary reductions on the
rents of the Mid-Lothian farms. Lord
Kinnaird may see in those tables the
fate which is in store for him; and he
cannot hope to escape it long, even by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
inserting, in his new leases, the most
stringent stipulations as to money
payments which legal ingenuity can
devise. It is just possible that "men of
business habits," retired shopkeepers,
and others of that class, may be
coaxed and persuaded into trying their
hands at a trade of which they know
literally nothing. They may be incautious
enough to put their names to
covenants, not conceived according to
Mr Caird's liberal principle, and so
pledge their capital for the fulfilment
of a bargain which common sense declares,
and experience proves, to be
preposterous. The necessary consequence
will be, that the rent must be
paid out of capital, a process which
cannot last long; and the unhappy
speculator, as he finds his earnings
disappearing, will curse the hour when
he yielded to the delusion, that high
farming must be profitable in spite
of the variations of price. The poor
seamstress, who weekly turns out of
hand her augmented number of improved
shirts&mdash;and who lately, though
on exceedingly erroneous principles,
has found a warm advocate in the
kind-hearted Mr Sydney Herbert&mdash;has,
in her own way, tested the value
of the experiment. There is more cotton
to be shaped, and more work to be
done, but the prices continue to fall.
She makes two additional shirts, but
she receives nothing for the additional
labour, because the remuneration for
each is beaten down. The free-trade
tariffs are the cause of her distress, but
the unfortunate creature is not learned
in statistics, and therefore does not
understand the source of her present
misery. No more, probably, do the
female population of the Orkney
islands, whom Sir Robert Peel reduced
to penury some years ago, by a single
stroke of his pen, through the article
of straw-plait. From Lerwick to the
Scilly Isles, the poor industrious
classes were made the earliest victims.
The tiller of the land is
liable to the operation of the same
rules. By the outlay of capital, he
forces an additional crop, but, the
value of produce having fallen, his
returns, estimated in money, are just
the same as before. If the maintenance
of rents throughout the United
Kingdom depends simply upon the
supply of dupes, we are afraid that
the Whig landlords will speedily find
themselves in a sorry case.</p>

<p>We by no means wish to treat this
question as if Scotland alone were
concerned. The English agriculturist,
who knows that strict economy is the
rule in northern farming, will readily
acknowledge that our observations
have even greater force when applied
to his own case. It would have been
presumption in us, had we passed
beyond the limits of our own field of
illustration, which, however, will bear
comparison with any other. On the
whole, we think it will hardly be questioned,
that, if high farming in the Lothians
or on the Border is a losing trade,
it cannot be made profitable elsewhere
within the boundaries of Britain.</p>

<p>We are told that this is a landlord's
question; and we find Messrs
Bright and Cobden, with more than
their usual malignity, chuckling over
the prospects of the downfall of a class
which they honour with their rancorous
hatred. They do not affect to
disguise the pleasure which they derive
from knowing that, at this moment,
the rents are being paid from
the farmer's capital; and, so far, they
bear important testimony to the truth
of the calculations we have submitted.
It is not our business at present to
diverge into ethics, else we might be
tempted to hazard a few observations
on the brutal and un-British spirit
which pervades the whole of their late
harangues. All that we shall do now
is to remark that they are trying, by
every means in their power, to persuade
the tenantry of Britain that this
is a mere landlords' question; and we
are bound to confess, that such writers
as Lord Kinnaird have materially
contributed towards fostering this
delusion. A very little consideration,
however, will show the utter fallacy
of such an opinion; and we feel convinced
that the good sense of the tenantry
of Scotland will interfere to
prevent them from being led astray
by the devices of their inveterate
enemies.</p>

<p>So far as we can gather from the
opinions enunciated by the leaders of
the Manchester school, at their late gatherings,
their view resolves itself into
this. Abolish the rents, and agriculture
will go on as before. Little argument
is necessary to show, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
proposition, even were it admitted, is
by no means in favour of the farmer.</p>

<p>Our excellent contemporary, <cite>The
Standard</cite>, has already disposed of it
in a single sentence:&mdash;<em>Wipe off the
rents, and you wipe away the class
which heretofore has paid the rents.</em>
Mr Bright would fain attempt to persuade
the farmers that they are altogether
independent of the landlords,
and that no suffering can reach them.
Have then the landlords, in most
instances, expended nothing on the
soil? Their outlay does not appear
in balance sheets, however large may
be its amount; but, were that outlay
added to the farmer's expenditure of
capital, there can be no doubt that,
even without rent, at present prices,
farming would be otherwise than profitable.
But did it never strike Mr
Bright that, failing rents, the landlords
must necessarily take their
farms into their own hands, as indeed
has occurred already in several districts
of the country? We presume
he does not contemplate a quiet confiscation
of estates&mdash;if he does, confiscation
will not stop there. We
suppose the owner must still have the
option of keeping his property; and
if so, as he will derive no profit from
it in the shape of rent, he must either
farm it himself, or act as labourer on
wages under a farmer. We apprehend
there can be little doubt as to
the course he will take, when driven
to such an extremity. As a body,
tenant-farmers will cease to exist.
They may go to Poland if they please,
and employ their practical skill, and
such remnant of capital as they can
save from the wreck of their fortunes,
in the patriotic task of growing wheat
cheaper than before, for the British
manufacturing market; but in this
country there will be no longer any
room for them. We shall be thankful
to know if any course more feasible
can be suggested; but indeed ingenuity
seems to be at fault, and the
Free-traders hardly affect to conceal
their conviction that such must be the
result. The following extract from a
leading article in the <cite>Times</cite> of 6th December,
will show the views entertained
by that very influential journal.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"If any landowners or tenants are
thoroughly persuaded that, under the
operation of free trade, land will yield no
rent to the owner, or no profit to the
farmer, let them dispose of their land or
their farms. The whole world lies before
them. The funds, the share-market,
trades and manufactures innumerable and
new ones every day, the colonies, the
United States, the Antipodes, Europe,
and literally the whole surface of the
globe, is open to the enterprise of wealthy
or ingenious men. Those who regard an
English landlord or yeoman as an animal
to be kept in a hothouse will think this
very cruel advice, but it is advice which
nine-tenths of our fellow-subjects have
to follow, at least once in their lives.
The law of change is impressed on the
whole face of society. Man improves by
being transplanted to new soils, and
grafted on new stocks. Why should not
the heroic qualities of our gentry be employed
in the improvement of the world,
and in the spread of civilisation, religion,
and manners? Why should not the skill
of our farmers be turned to account in
making the whole earth bring forth its
full produce? As it happens, there are no
classes actually concerned in the material
and operations of industry who can change
their place with so little difficulty or cost
as the owners and cultivators of the soil.
The landowner can sell his estate, and
buy another, or invest the money in the
funds, any day he pleases. The tenant
can dispose of his lease and his stock
without much sacrifice. Can an attorney,
a physician or surgeon, a beneficed clergyman,
a merchant, a retail shopkeeper, or,
indeed, any commercial or professional
person, change his locality ten miles without
sacrificing at least 30 or 50 per cent
of his present income? Yet many such
are obliged to migrate, and resign present
income, besides all the other losses
involved in a move, in the mere hope of
ultimately improving their condition. As
for our agricultural labourers, who, we
are often told, are the staple of our population,
for many years the whole force
and pressure of our social institutions has
been applied to compel their migration.
Landlord, tenant, parson, overseer, and
even a man's own fellow-labourers, are
all in a conspiracy to elbow him out of
the crowd, and the sooner he yields to
that pressure the better. Why, then,
should it be thought a hard thing to give
the same advice to the landowner and the
farmer?"</p></blockquote>

<p>So write the Free-traders, and we
wish them joy of their argument.
Henceforth, then, we ought to abandon
all foolish scruples connected
with home, and kindred, and country&mdash;all
national considerations, all
the ties and common feelings that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
hitherto have held Englishmen together!
Truly, the cause which
requires such advocacy as this must
be in a desperate condition. Such
language however, extravagant and
puerile as it is, has some extrinsic
value; for it shows us the utter selfishness
and entire disregard of the
Free-traders for every other interest
in Britain except their own.</p>

<p>We shall probably be told that we
are alarmists. It is no new charge
against us. The same thing was
said when we denounced the policy of
government towards the West Indian
interest, and also when we foreshadowed
the commercial crisis which
overtook us in 1847. One exception
may be taken to our agricultural
views, on the ground that farms have
been let in Scotland without any
diminution of rent. We allow that
such is the case. We admit that, even
during the bygone year, there has been
considerable competition for farms;
and we know very well that this circumstance
has tended to allay the fears of
many. But, after all, what does it
prove? Nothing more, we apprehend,
than that the farmer is most reluctant
to abandon the profession to which he
has been bred, and in which his capital
is invested; and that, in times of
notoriously unsettled and vacillating
legislation, he may be, perhaps, too
sanguine as to the possibility of another
change. The fact that some farms, in
various parts of the country, have, of
late, brought full and even higher
rents, is not enough to warrant the
idea that present engagements can be
met. It does not follow that these
will continue to be paid; nor do the
parties themselves, we presume, expect
to be able to fulfil their engagements,
if future prices are such as we
have felt constrained to reckon them.
We have seen of late, in other matters,
how easily people are deceived
by sanguine anticipations; and it has
recently been lamentably proved, that
it is often long before disastrous events
produce their due effect in indicating
true value. If, in the less intricate
matter of railway speculations, we
have seen men who boasted of their
superior information, involving themselves
in the downward course of these
unfortunate concerns, under the idea
that the turning-point of depression
had been attained, and that golden
profits might be realised, is it marvellous
if the farmer should be deceived
in a matter which has been so much
mystified, and which his predilections
and peculiar position, in most instances,
will not admit of his viewing
calmly and dispassionately, even if he
possessed the means of correct information?
His education and habits
compel him to endeavour to continue
his occupation at all hazards. If
once he abandon his calling, he is out
of a situation as well as a home. It
often happens, besides, and now it
is peculiarly the case, that, to dispose
of his stocking&mdash;a necessity incumbent
upon the loss of his farm&mdash;is to make a
sacrifice of his property. At present,
live stock is from 15 to 20 per cent
under what he has been in the habit
of receiving for the last few years.
Hence, upon such a vexed question
as the effects of the corn laws, modified
and free, have become, it is only
natural that, in his doubt, and darkness,
and perplexity, he should stretch
a point to keep possession of his occupation;
trusting that, if matters continue
to be adverse, his landlord will
have the like commiseration for him
which it is his duty to testify for his
neighbour, who, under other circumstances,
is also writhing beneath the
pressure. In such a case, rent becomes
altogether a question of chance, left to
be modified and controlled by after
circumstances.</p>

<p>In this view it is not difficult to
understand why farms falling out of
lease have been taken at rates absurdly
disproportioned to the present prices
of agricultural produce. Ask any
intelligent farmer, who has placed
himself in this position, and he will
frankly confess that he does not expect
to be able to pay his rent, unless
some very material change in the
value of produce shall take place.
How should he think otherwise? In
the better districts of Scotland, farming
has been carried so high that
there is hardly any margin left for
improvement. Up to a certain point,
the soil may be artificially stimulated;
but, that point once reached, any
further appliances become positively
hurtful, and defeat the intentions of
the grower. The flower of our tenantry&mdash;the
men whose exertions have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
made the land what it is&mdash;can go but
a little way further. Nor can the
severest moralist tax them with a
breach of probity if they should enter
into bargains which, under the operation
of the present laws, they cannot
possibly fulfil. The legislature took no
account of them when it abolished
protection. Parliament dealt with
them more tyrannically than any
irresponsible monarch would have
dared to deal with a people far less
intelligent and far less cognisant of
their rights. The laws have ceased
to be, in the estimation of the multitude,
final. We now consider them,
and most justly, as mere make-shifts
which cannot stand against the pressure
of a well-organised agitation;
and men speculate on the probability
of their changes, just as gamblers
make adventures on the probable
fluctuations of the funds. No man
can deny that such is the case. Free
trade is in the ascendant to-day:
to-morrow, protection may be uppermost.
A sad state of things truly;
but such as must necessarily occur,
when statesmen, whose heads have
grown hoary in office, desert principle
to adopt expediency, and repudiate
the professions of a whole lifetime, for
the sake of outwitting their political
opponents. Our steadfast conviction
is, that unsettled legislation has tended
more than anything else to prevent
an immediate depreciation in the rents.
Foster gambling, and you create
gamblers. Farms are now taken on
speculation, with the view, not to
increased production of the land, but
to further changes in the experimental
policy of the nation.</p>

<p>But in reality we apprehend that
such cases are the exception, and not
the rule. We have heard it trumpeted
abroad that certain farms in East
Lothian were let during the course of
last year at an advance. We have
taken pains to investigate this matter;
and we find on inquiry that, in
some cases, such farms have been
taken by new men of little agricultural
experience. Lord Kinnaird
may be glad to hear this, but we cannot
view it in the light of an encouraging
symptom. Others, no
doubt, have been retaken, probably
under the influence of such considerations
as we have just stated. Again,
we find that some farms in the south
of Scotland are very differently situated
now, than they were before.
The extension of the railway system
has given to such of them as are near
stations, advantages which were enjoyed
heretofore by such farms only
as were in the immediate vicinity of
large towns; and in this way their
value has been increased. But it is
quite evident, that, unless some extraordinary
fallacy lurks in the tables
which we have given above&mdash;unless
the leading practical agriculturists of
Scotland are either possessed by some
monstrous arithmetical delusion, or
banded in some organised conspiracy
to mislead the public mind&mdash;no exceptional
case can be admitted as of
any weight whatever in determining
the general question. On the part of
ourselves, and of our correspondents,
we not only invite, but we broadly
challenge investigation. We desire
that the truth may be made known,
because any delusion on either side
must tend to the public detriment.</p>

<p>If our statistics should be admitted
as correct, we think it must be clear
to demonstration that British agriculture
cannot maintain itself longer
against the competition of the foreign
grower. We believe it impossible for
any man who has attended to the
minute statements given above, to
arrive at an opposite conclusion. No
appliances, no energy, no high farming,
can avail in this ruinous struggle.
To expect that more capital will be
embarked in so losing a trade, is perfectly
idle. Even if tenants had the
wish to do so, they would fail for the
want of means. It will be seen from
the preceding tables what amount of
capital is usually perilled on Scottish
farms, and what amount of loss, at
present prices, the farmer must necessarily
sustain. Even in better times,
few men could afford to do as much as
has already been done by the agriculturists
of the Lothians and Berwickshire;
and, under existing circumstances,
the great body of the tenantry
cannot find the means to continue
their ordinary operations. With capital
exhausted and credit denied to
him, what is the farmer to do? The
question is one which we would fain
see answered, and that immediately,
by those who have brought us to the
present pass. It cannot remain long
unanswered, without such an augmentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of distress as must render
all remedy ineffectual.</p>

<p>So far we have spoken for the
tenant, who, as an old contracting
party, has been utterly sacrificed by
free-trade legislation. As a new
contractor, we have shown that he
is placed under circumstances of
peculiar disadvantage, arising from
ignorance as to his real position, his
past exertions, and his future prospects.
Had we spoken rashly on
this matter, we should have been
liable to the utmost blame; but we
have not put forward any one position
which is not based upon facts,
laboriously ascertained, and closely
scrutinised; and all these are open to
challenge, if any assailant has the
mind, or the power, to refute us.
We state nothing which is not
founded on evidence of the clearest
kind, and we shall be glad if our
statements can be met in a precisely
similar manner.</p>

<p>We observe that Mr William
Ewart Gladstone, in an address delivered
at the late meeting of the
Fettercairn Farmers' Club, has taken
a different line of argument; and if
his views should prove to be correct,
we must necessarily admit that the
British agriculturist has no ground
for complaint at all. We are, it
seems, making a vast deal of noise
without anything to justify it. We
are clamouring about an imaginary
evil, when we ought to be deeply
grateful for natural benefits vouchsafed
to us. So thinks Mr Gladstone,
or at least so he speaks; and
as his undeniable talents, and the
high official position which he formerly
occupied, entitle him to an
attentive hearing, we shall briefly
recapitulate his views. These are
not new, for, if we recollect right,
they were enunciated so early as
last spring by the Hon. Sydney
Herbert, a gentleman belonging to
the same political section as Mr
Gladstone, and they were then triumphantly
refuted by Mr John Ellman, in
his letter addressed to the Duke of
Bedford. Since that time, however,
another harvest has intervened, and
Mr Gladstone now takes up the
argument of his friend under better
auspices, and with a greater show of
plausibility.</p>

<p>Foreign competition, according to
Mr Gladstone, is not the cause of low
prices. "This is not," says he, "the
first time that we have had difficulties.
We have had many periods
when low prices prevailed. Certainly,
at present, prices are extremely low;
but, in many parts of the country,
there is a sort of compensation for
these low prices arising from great
abundance&mdash;the result of improved
processes of growing the crop, and, of
consequence, an improved yield. With
regard to the cause of declining prices,
I cannot adopt the line of argument
of those who look only to importations
as the chief cause. I do not pretend
to speak so accurately of Scotland,
but, as to England, <em>the wheat crop
this year was the largest ever known</em>.
Upon one single acre of land, of
average quality, no less than sixty-eight
bushels of wheat have been
taken from the crop of this year. I
must also point out the fact to
you, that, although the crop is the
largest, the prices are by no means
the lowest we have seen&mdash;for instance,
in the year 1835, when the sliding-scale
was in full operation, we had
wheat at 35s. per quarter, <em>and this not
only for a short time, but for the whole
year</em>. If it be true, therefore, that, at
the present time, we have prices 5s.
per quarter higher than they were in
1835, with a corn-law prohibitory till
wheat rose to 70s. per quarter, then I
cannot see that we have any such
great cause for alarm as many imagine."</p>

<p>The first remark that we shall make
with reference to this statement, is,
that it is <em>utterly incorrect</em>. We do not
know from what source Mr Gladstone
ordinarily draws his figures, but if any
one will consult the official tables of
returns for the year 1835, he will find
that the average of wheat was 39s. 4d.,
and not 35s., as Mr Gladstone has
unwarrantably asserted. We have
gone over the weekly averages for the
whole of that year, and we find that
wheat was <em>never once quoted</em> so low as
35s. In a matter of this kind, accuracy
is a cardinal virtue, and we cannot
allow such a statement as this to
pass unnoticed. The following are
<em>the lowest</em> weekly and aggregate
averages for the whole year, taken
from the official tables, and we have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>

Mr Gladstone may have the full benefit
of the nearest approximation to his

<p>What, then, are we to think of Mr
Gladstone's averment, that, in 1835,
we had wheat at 35s., "and this not
only for a short time, but for the
whole year?" Not even for the
week have we a vestige of any such
quotation! This is blunder the first,
and it is so serious a one, that, on
his own showing, it is enough to
invalidate the whole of his argument.
<span class="smcap">It is not a fact</span> "that, at
the present time, we have prices 5s.
per quarter higher than they were in
1835." The difference is a fractional
part of a shilling; and if Mr. Gladstone
wishes to find a time when the prices
were five shillings lower than at present,
he must go back to the year
1779; and, in travelling towards that
period, he will meet with some startling
facts in the financial history of
the country, which are well worthy of
observation. In 1779, he will find
wheat at 33s. 8d., the produce of such
a harvest that the export of grain
exceeded the import by 217,222
quarters. But he will also find that
the national debt, at that period, was
just one-fourth of what it now is;
and that the poor-rates of England,
instead of touching eight millions,
were considerably short of two.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is not true that the last
wheat crop was the largest ever known
in England. This is a wild and utterly
extravagant assertion. The bygone
crop was a good one, less on account
of quality than of gift; but every
agriculturist knows that, within the
experience of the present generation,
we have had far finer crops. That of
1815 was enormous in its yield&mdash;so
great that we did not import a single
quarter of grain, and the average price
of wheat for that year was 63s. 8d.
The crop of 1822 was not very much
inferior. These are notorious instances;
but in order to ascertain,
with as much precision as possible,
the relative quality of the bygone
crop, we submitted the statement of
Mr. Gladstone to one of the most extensive
corn-dealers in Leith, and the
following is his reply. "Mr. Gladstone's
statement is certainly very unlike
that of a person of his high
authority; though I conceive it as
calculated to do much mischief in the
present depressed state of the corn-trade,
as many people will judge of it
from Mr. Gladstone's high standing.
In my opinion, however, nothing can
be more absurd than estimating a
crop by a <em>yard</em> in any field, or by a
single acre. We hear now a great
deal of the land being more productive,
by draining and other improvements;
and it was to be expected that, when
a good wheat season occurred, we
should have more wheat than in previous
years; but, from all the confirmation
we have yet obtained, I am
by no means disposed to believe that
the last crop is a great one, far less
that it is greater than ever known. The
present generation, I have no doubt,
have seen larger crops of wheat than
our forefathers; but I think 1814,
1815, 1822, 1825, 1831, 1832, 1833,
1834, 1835, 1841, and 1842, were
better seasons than the last. Essex,
and several other English counties
which had bad crops in 1848, have
much greater crops in 1849; but Lincolnshire,
and several other very important
counties, have very deficient
crops on certain varieties of soil. All
that can be said of the present crop
is, that it is a full one, generally
speaking. More of it, I am sure,
will yield under 40 bushels an acre
than over 40; and very little, indeed,
60 or 68, as Mr. Gladstone says a
<em>single</em> acre has produced." So much
for the general yield; let us now revert
to the seasons which Mr. Gladstone
has selected for comparison.</p>

<p>The crop of 1835 was not only
larger than that of 1849, but it came
to us under circumstances which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
entirely preclude a comparison of the
years, if prices are to be taken as a
criterion. <span class="smcap">The crop of 1835 was
the last of a series of fine ones.</span>
We subjoin the statistics from 1830,
which was a bad season, to 1836,
when the harvest was again unfavourable:&mdash;</p>

</table></div>

<p>It will thus be seen that it was a
succession of good harvests which
brought down the prices gradually
from 66s. 4d. in 1831, to 39s. 4d. in
1835. Last year we had one good
harvest following a remarkably bad
one, and yet Mr Gladstone would attempt
to persuade us that the present
reduction of price arises solely
from excessive plenty, as in 1835!
If it were so, where would be the
room for that importation, which,
during the first eight months of the
bygone year, has more than doubled
that of 1848, for the corresponding
period? For his own sake, we are
sorry to find Mr Gladstone resorting
to fallacies so exceedingly flimsy and
transparent. Surely he must be
aware that the extreme depreciation
of price, which is the cause of agricultural
distress, could not by any possibility
be the result of the late harvest&mdash;for
this unanswerable reason, that, in
the earlier parts of the year, before
the corn had shot in the fields, prices
were rapidly dwindling. The deficient
crop of 1848 could not have put prices
down&mdash;we presume that even Mr
Gladstone will not maintain <em>that</em>&mdash;and
yet, for the week ending April 7, 1849
we find the averages of England as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">

</table></div>

<p>So then, after a poor crop in 1848, we
find prices lower than they were in
1834, after a series of fine crops, and
we are calmly asked to adopt the conclusion
that a single good crop in
1849 has done all the mischief! Mr
Gladstone might just as well tell us
that our present prices are affected by
the crop of 1850, which is now lying
in embryo in the seed.</p>

<p>But we have not yet done with Mr
Gladstone, who goes on to assert that
low prices have nothing to do with
importations from abroad. This position
he tries to fortify by rather an ingenious
process, as will be seen from the
following extract from his speech:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Let me point out also that I had the
curiosity to obtain an account of the last
month's importations into this country,
and, on comparing the same with those of
1848, the decrease this year is very remarkable;
and, besides, with diminished
importations this year, must be taken into
account the fact, that from the condition
of the crop this year, as compared with
the last, the value of our grain is at least
5s. superior to the mere nominal price.
In October, last year, you had good prices
for wheat; in this year, bad. I ask, was
this owing to importations from abroad,
or was it not? I give you the result in
figures, which I think will convince you
what is the reason of the low prices. In
October 1848, the importation of wheat to
this country was no less than 506,000
quarters; in 1849, it is only 154,000 quarters.
How are we to account for this,
but simply from the great abundance of
wheat at home this year, while in 1848
the supply was somewhat short; and, so
far as regards the English farmer, I consider
he is better off this year, with his
large crop and low prices, than he was
last, with his small crop and high prices."</p></blockquote>

<p>If anything could make us lose our
patience, while dealing with so momentous
a subject, it would be the sight
of such statements as these. Observe
how the matter stands. Mr Gladstone
is arguing that importations from
abroad do not affect prices here, and,
by way of proof, he gives us the statistics
of a single month. He says&mdash;Last
October you had good prices and
large importations: this October you
have bad prices and diminished importation.
<em>Ergo</em>, importations have
nothing to do with prices! Is Mr
Gladstone ignorant of the fact,
that, for the first eight months of
the year 1849, the quantity of grain
imported was more than double
that of the preceding season, and
that almost every warehouse in our
ports is filled almost to bursting with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
foreign grain? Is he aware that this
diminished import for October, if
extended over the year, would give
an amount greater than was brought
in during any famine year previous to
1839? Let us see how this matter
stands, adopting his very favourable
calculations.</p>

<p>The October imports, which Mr
Gladstone considers as being reduced
in consequence of the good harvest at
home, would, if spread over the year,
amount to 1,848,000 quarters&mdash;being
very little less than the average
amount imported from 1836 to 1840,
when we had five bad or indifferent
seasons in succession. Mr Gladstone,
however, we apprehend, leaps too
rapidly at his conclusions. He should
have waited until the frost set in, and
then, perhaps, he might have been
able to point to a materially diminished
importation. We should like to know
how he will dispose of the ascertained

<p>being equal to 513,615 quarters of
all kinds of grain for the month!
These are the diminished importations!
But we shall come down even
later, and inquire what sort of proportion
the arrivals of foreign grain bear
to those of British growth in the
London market, according to the last
accounts. We copy from the <cite>Times</cite>
of December 11:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Corn Exchange</span>, Monday, <em>Dec. 10.</em>&mdash;Throughout
the past week, there have
been good arrivals of wheat, barley, and
oats into this market from abroad, although
of wheat the quantity reported
has been less than of other grain. Of
English corn of any kind, (if we except
barley,) the total reports are insignificant,
and but a few cargoes of oats from Ireland.
The state of the trade, on the
several market days, was languid, and
even at lower prices for barley and oats,
buyers were indisposed to get into
stock."</p></blockquote>

<p>The following is a statement of the
arrivals of grain at London from the
3d to the 8th of December, which
may serve to indicate the sources
from which the population of our vast
metropolis is fed; and we leave Mr
Gladstone to reconcile it, as he best
can, with his new theory of importations:&mdash;</p>

<p>So then, after the harvesting of
"the largest wheat crop ever known
in England," and at the dead season
of the year, when the navigation of
the Elbe is closed, the importation of
foreign wheat into the London market
exceeds the arrival of English wheat
by a ratio of nearly five to one! And,
with such facts before us, we are forbidden
to believe that imports affect
prices! We hope, when we next meet
Mr Gladstone, to find him in a more
logical humour, and better prepared
with his facts.</p>

<p>It is not surprising if, in a controversy
of this kind, we should find the
Free-traders openly contradicting each
other, and very often themselves, in
the advice which they gratuitously
offer to the agriculturist. One section
recommends further outlay on
the land, more extended and elaborate
tillage, and prophesies in return
an augmented cereal crop. Another
totally repudiates this view, but
advises that the loss should be made
good by green crops, wider pastures,
and an infinite multiplication of cattle.
The former philanthropists want
more grain; the latter insist upon an
extended consumption of butcher
meat. The tendency of late legislation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
has been in favour of the latter
view, and the consequence has been a
depreciation in the value of cattle
throughout the kingdom, of at least
from 15 to 20 per cent. The consumer
has not yet got the full benefit
of it, but the farmer has incurred the
loss; and we know instances of pasturings
on which, for the last two
years, not a single shilling of profit
has been realised. The cattle when
sent to market, after being fattened,
have brought the same price which
was given for them in their lean and
hungry condition. The Free-traders
are very bold about cattle, alleging
that, in this respect, there is nothing
to fear from the effects of foreign
competition. And undoubtedly, to a
casual observer, this would appear to
be one of the least objectionable
parts of their scheme. Still there is
something mysterious in the fact of
the great depreciation. The prices of
cattle have fallen, until profit has
been nearly extinguished; and if we
exclude altogether the idea of foreign
competition, the necessary conclusion
will be, that the supply has vastly
exceeded the demand. This is but
poor comfort to those who are told to
look to green crops for their remuneration.
But we think that the subject
requires a closer examination than it
has yet received. We are convinced
that the depreciation of live stock is
intimately connected with importation,
and the result of our inquiries
will show whether we are right or
wrong. But first let us glance at the
ascertained effects of importation under
the relaxed tariff.</p>

<p>The first fruit of the unrestricted
trade in live stock&mdash;which exhibited
a number that mounted up, for the
first five years, at a rate increasing
annually fourfold, until the number
of "oxen and bulls" reached from
1385 in 1843, to 27,831 in 1848&mdash;was
no doubt sufficiently alarming.
But, judging from the trade of the
year ending 1848, and of the present
season, this influx would appear to
have reached its full. Assuming this
to be the case&mdash;as the entire number
would not, on a rough calculation,
furnish more than a week or ten days'
supply of beef to the whole country&mdash;perhaps
there is not much reason to
apprehend any great depression in
home prices from the influence of
the importation of foreign <em>live</em> stock.
Besides, from the tendency of recent
improvements in agriculture&mdash;should
these fortunately continue in operation&mdash;to
increase materially the supplies
of beef and mutton, it is possible
that these necessaries could, in
future, be afforded at such a price as
to exclude the probability of any
great accession to our importations
for many years.</p>

<p>We believe that the only considerable
harm which has resulted from
the importation of live stock, has
been the importation of two very
fatal diseases, which have, since then,
carried off numbers of cattle and
sheep, and which, like most epidemics,
will in all human probability become
permanent. The mortality was so
serious, that Parliament has already
passed an act establishing a sort of
conditional quarantine; and it has
been calculated by those who are
skilled in such matters, that the number
of animals that have died in consequence,
is considerably greater than
the whole amount of the importation.
In this way it is easy to reckon the
amount of our losses and our gains.</p>

<p>But there is a farther importation
of butchers' meat in another shape,
which is far more difficult to contend
against&mdash;namely, that of "cured beef,
bacon, and pork." The importation
of these articles has increased so
rapidly and enormously, since the introduction
of free trade&mdash;the two
latter to upwards of sixfold since
1847&mdash;that the whole together, it
may be reckoned, now afford a quantity
of food exceeding in weight four
times that of the "oxen and bulls"
imported during the last year. This
is a mere beginning, but already the
effects of it have been widely and
calamitously felt. It is not only
affecting the graziers, but it is displacing
a large and hitherto flourishing
trade, both in Britain and in Ireland;
and, if carried out further, as it clearly
will be, not one single rallying point
or chance of escape will be left to the
British agriculturist.</p>

<p>The following is the statement of a
Liverpool correspondent, dated 6th
December last:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I enclose you a price-current,
with the latest quotations of American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
provisions, which are the prices
to the wholesale dealers. In the
best qualities of beef and pork, the
trade generally get 5s. to 10s. a package
profit, and on an <em>ordinary</em> article
a much larger margin is allowed.</p>

<p>"American beef is far superior to
Irish, and brings more money. The
import of the latter is about 1000
tierces&mdash;of the former, 20,000 tierces.
Irish pork stands higher than American,
and the finest quality eastern
will sell within 5s. per barrel of Irish.
The import of Irish is about 3000
barrels&mdash;of American, 35,000 barrels."</p>

<p>These are figures which may well
astound the boldest Free-trader; for
they show that the provision trade is
altogether passing from our hands.
To those who regard the welfare of
Great Britain, they furnish additional
proof of the headlong rate of our
decline. But we have yet other
statements to make, for which, we
are certain, no one was prepared,
though the facts they disclose are the
necessary consequence of such comparative
prices as we have just given.
<em>We believe that the British navy, which
is victualled by contract, is at this
moment supplied from foreign, and not
British produce!</em></p>

<p>We crave the special attention of
the reader to the following letter
from a gentleman residing in Dundee,
who stands nearly at the head of the
meat-curing business in Scotland.
We have authority to give his name,
if that should be considered necessary.
His letter bears date 12th November
1849:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In reply to the queries put to me
by you, as to the value, &amp;c. of foreign
provisions, I beg leave to hand you a
statement of the difference of price
of Scotch and American beef, calculating
the Scotch beef at the present
low price of 40s. per cwt., and the
present price of my American prime
mess beef at 87s. 6d. per tierce of
304 lbs., the quality of which is not
inferior to the best Scotch beef.</p>

<p>"By this statement you will see that
there is a difference of £2, Os. 6d. per
tierce, or 14s. 9d. per cwt., in favour
of the American; besides, I allow 2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub>
per cent off for cash, which I hardly
think the butcher does at the above
price. Neither am I the importer of
this beef, but purchase at the sales in
Liverpool, though a broker; neither
am I an underseller, 87s. 6d., (2<sup><small>1</small></sup>&frasl;<sub><small>2</small></sub> per
cent off,) being about the general price
for such an article in various markets.
Owing to the low price and excellent
quality of American beef, almost every
ship from this port, going to the south,
takes it in preference to our home
beef; and when in England, last
month, we found there was nothing
else used by the English vessels, with
the exception of a little fresh beef,
which they take with them when they
go out; and one house in London informed
me that they had supplied the
navy with 3080 tierces of American
beef.</p>

<p>"American pork can be purchased
at a very low price, but as yet I have
seen none fine, and there are but few
of our shipowners that would take it.
There is, however, hardly anything
else than American hams and flitch
bacons sold in this and other manufacturing
towns; and although the
quality is not fine, still the price is
low, and purchasers are to be found
on that account.</p>

<p>"Hamburg beef and pork are both
of a good quality, and sell generally
about 10s. per cwt. below the price of
Scotch. I had, however, an offer of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
500 barrels from one of the largest
houses in Hamburg fully 15 per
cent below what I can afford to cure
Scotch; it, however, being last year's
cure, I did not accept of the offer.</p>

<p>"There are several houses opened
lately in Hamburg, who are curing a
first-rate article in a first-rate style
for the London market; and one of
my London correspondents, writing
lately, informs me of a house in London
(to which I have sent a great
quantity of pickled pork for the last
twenty years,) having opened a curing
establishment in Hamburg for
the cure of pickled pork on the Scotch
system. It was doing up nicely, and
affecting the market for Scotch greatly;
he adds that, from the price and
quality of the article, it would be a
death-blow to the Scotch curers. I
may also say that it looks very like it.
Some years ago I was curing about
seven tons a-week for the London
market alone, and found plenty of
demand; now, at the present day, I
can hardly get clear of two tons
a-week, and that at very low prices&mdash;so
low, indeed, that we are compelled
to look for other markets in
other places; and I am confining myself
principally to prime mess pork
among the shipping of this and other
ports. These are facts which I can
authenticate, as I have had many
years' experience in the curing both
of beef and pork for home and foreign
markets; and you are at perfect
liberty to make any use of this information
which you may think proper."</p>

<p>From this, and other statements of
a similar nature which have reached
us, and which we refrain from inserting,
solely on account of the unusual
space which our remarks must otherwise
occupy, we entertain no doubt
whatever that in the article of meat
the competition is as formidable as in
that of grain; and that there is no
limit to the extent of competition,
save the ultimate inability of the
burdened British agriculturist to hold
his ground against the untaxed and
unreciprocating foreigner. In a very
short time, if the system is not perfected
at present, we may expect
to see the rations of the army, the
stores of the navy, and the contracts
for all large establishments, supplied
from foreign produce. The displacement
of home industry, and the
extinguishment of important trades
indicated in the foregoing letter, are
perhaps matters of minor importance
in such a revolution as this: nevertheless,
they are too serious to be contemplated
without the greatest alarm.</p>

<p>So stands the agricultural interest
at this moment&mdash;an interest, be it observed,
in which the prosperity of wellnigh
three-fourths of the population of
this mighty empire is concerned. We
might say, with perfect truth, the interest
of the whole population; but as
those of the Manchester school deny
their identity with the rest of us, we
must exclude them; and they cannot
think us ungracious or illiberal if we
assign to them a number of adherents
far greater than we believe they actually
possess. These are the effects of
what they call free trade; <small>BUT FREE
TRADE IT IS NOT</small>, being simply the
most shameful species of one-sided
and partial legislation. The Manchester
men dare not, for their souls, carry
out the principle to its full extent.
The agriculturist has a right to demand
that this shall be done; that,
exposed as he is to the competition of
the world, and burdened, as he must
remain, with debts contracted ages
ago to the profit of the capitalist, and
burdens swollen to their present
amount by manufacturing pauperism,
no other class shall be protected from
a similar free competition. No plea
for revenue duties to be raised upon
customs can be held valid in equity
now. Why should there still exist a
protective duty of from ten to fifteen per
cent against foreign manufactures?
Why is any one portion of our consumption
to be taxed, whilst another is allowed
to go free? Are we not entitled
to demand that the same measure
which has been dealt to us, shall be
meted out to every man in Great Britain
and Ireland, let his trade or occupation
be what it may? Are we not entitled
to say this much to the manufacturers,
who were foremost in the
late movement&mdash;You have compelled
us to compete with Poland for grain
on equal terms: you therefore must
in future compete with the foreign
manufacturer on a similar condition
of equality? Why are we to pay
fifteen per cent duty for foreign silk
manufactures; for velvets, gauzes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
satins, and suchlike? Why ten per
cent for more than a hundred articles
of consumption, including cotton,
woollen, and hair manufactures, lace,
gauze, brass, brocade, stoneware, steel,
&amp;c.? Why should we be prohibited
from growing, if we can do it,
our own tobacco? Why are Messrs
Cobden and Bright, and their confederates,
to nestle under the wing of
protection, whilst the agriculturalist is
left utterly bare? Apart from policy,
and simply on the ground of justice,
we denounce such infamous partiality.
If, without even the shadow of a coming
reciprocity on the part of foreign
nations, we are desired to face competition,
let there be no exceptions
whatever. There can be, and there
is, no just medium between entire free
trade and equitable protection for all.
The voice of the whole nation will ere
long declare that no such medium shall
exist. What enormous amount of
benefit have Manchester manufacturers
conferred upon the community at
large, that they are to be bolstered up
by customs' duties, whilst the agriculturist
is trodden under foot? What
fractional portion of the greatness of
this country has been achieved by the
professors of the spinning-jenny and
the billy-roller, who now, in defiance
of history and of fact, would fain persuade
us that <small>THEY</small>, forsooth, are the
flower of Britain, the oracles of its
wisdom, the regulators of its policy,
the masters of the destiny of mankind?</p>

<p>It has been the fashion of late, for
those gentlemen, to talk as if the British
farmers were infinitely behind the
rest of the world in activity and intelligence.
It has been insinuated, that
they are unworthy occupants of an
exceedingly fertile soil, the capabilities
of which they have not tested, through
indolence and prejudice. Some such
accusation is implied, in all the
late stimulating exhortations to increased
exertion; and Lord Kinnaird
does not hesitate to tell us so, almost
in as many words. These are, no
doubt, recent discoveries, for it is not
long since we were told, by the very
same parties, that the superior agricultural
skill of our farmers was such
as to set foreign competition at defiance!
That was one of the principal
arguments employed for effecting
the repeal of the corn laws; but now,
when the results have proved totally
contrary to anticipation, it is convenient
to turn round, and accuse the
farmer of a total want of those very
qualities which were assigned as reasons
for the change. The obvious
fallacy in the first proposition, does
not make the inconsistency of the
second a whit less monstrous. No
wonder if the insult should be bitterly
felt by the agriculturist.</p>

<p>We are perhaps too apt, at the present
moment, to allow the former promises
of the Free-traders to slip out of
memory. If we were to search through
the abandoned rubbish of the League,
we should find ample evidence of the
gross fraud which was passed upon the
country by the leaders of that nefarious
faction. On the 19th December
last, we find Mr Cobden, at Leeds,
speaking as follows:&mdash;"I have always
contemplated a transition state in this
country, when there would be pinching
and suffering in the agricultural class
in passing from a vicious system to a
sound one; for you cannot be restored
from bad health to good without going
through a process of languor and suffering.
I have always looked forward
to that time." If this statement be
true&mdash;if Mr Cobden did "always contemplate"
such a state of matters&mdash;it
would not be difficult to convict him
of something worse than hypocrisy.
Three days later, at the memorable
meeting held at Huntingdon, Mr G.
Day, one of the speakers, made the
following pithy remarks:&mdash;"He
would refer, however, to the magnificent
promises which had been
held out by Mr Cobden as certain to
be realised by free trade, and to do so
he was free to refer to his letters.
'First, with regard to the landlord, I
do not mean to say that the landlords
will not get as good rents with free
trade as they have now with monopoly:
No doubt they will get on a
great deal better with free trade. The
landlord has nothing to fear.' Again,
he said, 'The landlords will have the
same rents with free trade as they
have at present.' In speaking of the
tenant-farmers he said, 'The tenant-farmer
will under free trade be an
independent man. I say that the
farmer has nothing to fear from competition.'
With regard to the poor,
what did this gentleman say? 'There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
would be no complaining poor in our
streets, no income-tax, no property-tax,
no poor-rates, but all classes
would be benefited by the adoption of
free trade.' These were the promises
made to them by a free-trader&mdash;the
leader of them; and in the <cite>Bread-Tax
Circular</cite>, No. 146, page 255, they
would find what he had read to them&mdash;Mr
Cobden's own words."</p>

<p>Does Mr Cobden admit that he
wrote this circular? If he does, perhaps
he will be good enough to
explain how he reconciles the views
contained in it with his new assertion
that he always contemplated a transition
state of suffering for the agricultural
class? We recommend him,
for his own sake, to clear this matter
up. Rash averments may be pardoned;
but deliberate double-dealing,
never.</p>

<p>"It is cruel," writes one of our
correspondents, a practical farmer of
great experience, "that the advocates
of the measure, in their exultation,
should pretend not to see that the
facts of the case have revealed a much
more alarming aspect to their opponents
than they anticipated; and that
even the danger to themselves, from
this cause, does not bring conviction
of the falsity of their views. They
affect to blame the farmer for ignorance,
want of skill and enterprise&mdash;forgetting
that, not long since, he was
wont to be held up as a pattern of all
that was superior in agricultural advancement,
and that our island stands
conspicuous among foreigners for its
garden cultivation. Still, we are told,
it is want of energy, and of a free
application of capital, which prevents
the British farmers from successfully
competing with the Continent: as if
overwhelming supplies of foreign corn,
and, consequently, a greatly reduced
price, were not sufficient reasons to
oblige the agriculturist to modify the
enterprise, and curtail the expenditure
for which he had hitherto been so distinguished.
Such unjust reflections
may serve to raise up and maintain a
feeling of prejudice against the farmer,
and to bring him into obnoxious comparison
with other arts, where science
has fortunately been more successfully
applied; but it is not to be expected,
that a hopeless rivalry, and a low price,
are to have the effect of stimulating to
efforts and outlay, beyond what was
induced by protection and a remunerating
return.</p>

<p>"It has been customary to bring
the farmer's position into contrast
with that of the manufacturer, who is
said to fear no foreign competition.
But is the comparison a just one?
The British manufacturer possesses
every advantage and appliance to
render his productions superior, and,
consequently, also cheaper. Britain
is the great mart of all the chief staples
of new produce. Her machinery is
the best&mdash;her fuel is the cheapest. On
the other hand, the farmer here is
deficient in <em>raw material</em>. He labours
an obstinate soil, for the use of which
he pays high; while his climate&mdash;the
main element to give security and
save expense&mdash;is far inferior to that of
his rival."</p>

<p>Our friend might have gone further;
for, if we enter into the comparison,
we shall find that the British farmer
has taken more advantage of his natural
position than the British manufacturer.
The true way of arriving at
a just conclusion upon this point is,
by contrasting, in the first instance,
the natural advantages enjoyed by
either class.</p>

<p>The motive power of the British
manufacturer is derived from coal, of
which he has an unlimited supply:
the motive power of the British farmer
is, except to a very small extent,
dependent upon animals, which is infinitely
more expensive and tedious;
requiring more work with less command
of power. The manufacturer
can try any experiment he pleases,
either in the construction of his machinery
or in the texture of his fabric,
in the course of a few days or weeks,
and adopt or reject it as best suits his
purpose: the farmer cannot attempt
any experiment upon his crops without
waiting a whole year for the result;
nor any upon his live stock in less than
two or three years. In the mean time,
his expenses and rent go on as usual.
The British manufacturer is not dependent
on the climate: the British
farmer is altogether so dependent;
the climate of this country being proverbially
uncertain and changeable, and
very often ungenial. We apprehend,
therefore, that, as to natural advantages,
the home manufacturer stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
on a far more advantageous footing
than the home agriculturist.</p>

<p>Let us next contrast the state of
the two classes abroad. The foreign
manufacturer has few natural advantages.
He does not possess the command
of coal for his motive power,
but is compelled to erect his factory
on the bank of some stream, without
regard, otherwise, to the convenience
of the locality. Iron for machinery is
far more expensive abroad than here;
in fact, most of the Continental machinery
is directly exported from Britain.
On the other hand, the foreign
farmer has all the advantages of an
equable, rich soil, and of a good and
steady climate.</p>

<p>Now, then, let us see how far the
British manufacturer, with all his natural
advantages, has surpassed his
foreign rival. Does he make a <em>better</em>
article than the foreigner? Can he
beat the German linen, the Russian
duck, the Swiss calico, the Saxon or
Austrian broad-cloth, the porcelains
of Dresden and Sèvres, or the silks,
stained papers, and prints of France?
If not, where is his superiority? As
to <em>designs</em>, it is notorious that he is
infinitely behind the Continent. No
doubt he sends ship-loads of flimsy
textures, with flaring colours and
incongruous patterns, to semi-barbarous
countries; and he can deluge
the markets of the world with
cheap goods, so furbished and tricked
out that they sell from appearance
only. But what hold has he of the
Continent? He cannot compete with
the manufacturers there in point of
<em>quality</em>: if he could make a better
article, no Zollvereins or combinations
would be able to keep him out. These
remarks apply to the bulk of our
manufactures, which are made for
foreign export; and these, in point of
quality, are precisely what we have
described them. There are undoubtedly
high class manufacturers here, especially
in the woollen and linen trades,
who supply the home market with high
class goods. But how do they stand?
<em>They are protected from foreign competition.</em>
It is in their favour that the
highest import duties remain; and, were
those restrictions removed to-morrow,
they would be undersold in the
British market. If any one thinks
we are wrong in this matter, we shall
be glad to hear him explain why the
duties remain? It cannot be for
<em>revenue</em>, since, if the British manufacturer
can beat his foreign rival, without
reciprocity, in the foreign market, it
would be an absurdity to suppose the
tables turned, and the foreign manufacturer
paying duty solely for the
sake of offering us a worse article
in Britain. If not for revenue, why
are the duties continued by statesmen
who have declared for free trade?
The answer is clear. <em>These are protective
duties</em>; and they are continued
for this reason, that, with all his
natural advantages, the British manufacturer
is not able to set Continental
competition at defiance.</p>

<p>Lastly, let us look to the British
farmer, in so far as energy and enterprise
are concerned, in contrast with
<em>his</em> rival. Here no detailed statement
is necessary. In spite of all natural
disadvantages, the soil of Britain is
better tilled than that of any other
country. We ask with a natural
pride, greater perhaps on account of
adverse circumstances, whether the
husbandry of the Lothians or of the
Border counties can be matched anywhere
out of Britain? Where, on the
surface of the globe, are the agriculturists
who have approached our tenantry
in the free outlay of capital,
ready intelligence, persevering enterprise,
and high professional skill? And
yet these men, admittedly at the head
of their craft, are to be told, forsooth,
that they have been indolent and ignorant;
and that retired tradesmen and
shopkeepers would make far better
farmers than they!</p>

<p>Judging from results, then, which
of the two classes has best done its
duty to the state? Which of the
two has availed itself most of the
advantages which lay within its reach,
and done most to overcome the power
of natural disadvantages? We apprehend
that, in all respects, the efforts of
the agriculturist have been greater
than those of the manufacturer. If the
former is to fall a sacrifice, let it not
at least be said that his indolence provoked
his fate. Out of agriculture
manufactures arose; and it is now,
we presume, the intention of our
rulers, that the one shall decay, and
the other survive: that the former
shall fall unprotected, and the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
struggle on with the whole monopoly
of protection. If so, the results
are clear enough. The manufacturer
who the other day accosted
Mr Muntz in the following terms:&mdash;"We
have eaten up the West Indian
planters, we have eaten the Irish landlords,
we have finished the colonies,
and now we are at the farmers; and
I don't know that we won't be eaten
ourselves,"&mdash;saw plainly the effect of
our legislation. Mr Cobden sees its
effect as well; but now, at the eleventh
hour, when the tide is turning against
him, he is straining every nerve to
maintain his false position. It is
the misfortune of demagogues, but
a great blessing to the rest of mankind,
that they invariably become
intoxicated with the first draught of
success, and seldom recover their reason.
So is it with Cobden now. His
late rabid harangue at Leeds, in
which he ransacked the vocabulary
for terms of abuse to heap upon the
landed gentry, was perhaps the most
insolent speech ever uttered in a free
nation. Surrounded by his fetid chimneys,
and his squalid dupes, he assumes
the tone of a dictator, holds out
threats of annihilation to all who dare
to question his policy, and actually
throws the gauntlet of defiance to the
constituencies of the United Kingdom!
There is no mistake at all about the
force and significance of his <small>SHALL</small>.
Right or wrong, every man in this empire
must walk as Cobden directs him,
else some nondescript vial of unutterable
wrath and retribution is to be
poured on his devoted head. These
are not the arguments of a reasonable
man, but the ravings of a positive maniac.
They will delude no one, whilst
they serve to show the base nature of
the man who utters them. The gladiator
of old, blowing sulphur flames
through a hollow nut, and passing himself
off for a god, was not a more rank
impostor than this seven times baffled
prophet. Is it not something unparalleled
in the annals of assurance to
find this person, himself protected, declaiming
against all protection, save
that of his immediate class, and avowing
his deliberate determination to
overthrow every institution of the
country, if we shall cease from enriching
the Polish magnates at the expense
of the British labourer? Let us
see what this man is doing. He,
whose fortunes were notoriously redeemed
by the questionable wages of
agitation, is now publicly announcing
his intention, if thwarted, of pursuing
a line of conduct which would necessarily
result in the abolition of the monarchy,
and the establishment of a
republic in Britain. There is no mistaking
the tendency of the hints which
are thrown out by him and his fellows.
They abstain, indeed, and certainly
wisely for themselves, from broadly
proclaiming their ends in such language
as would bring them within the
immediate grasp of the law. They
say nothing about the Crown, for that
would be dangerous; but they resolutely
avow their determination, if possible,
to pull down the aristocracy;
and they point to the abolition of the
House of Peers as a measure which,
at some future period, may engage
their serious attention. Add
to this their perpetual laudation of
American institutions, as preferable
to our own&mdash;their open and avowed
sympathy with the insurgents of democratic
Europe&mdash;their bitter and
malignant abuse of every one who
has been instrumental in putting down
insurrection&mdash;their scheme for abandoning
the colonies as worthless appendages,
and so breaking up the integrity
of the empire&mdash;their proposals,
so violently urged and reiterated, of
such a reduction in the army and
navy, as would render both arms of
the service utterly inefficient&mdash;add all
these, and we shall be at no loss to
discover the real aim of this foul and
scandalous confederacy. We are
aware that it is somewhat difficult to
define the limits of sedition; still Mr
Cobden had better have a care of his
language whilst indulging in such
revelations as he has of late chosen to
set forth. It will be no child's-play
if he actually should attempt to put the
smallest of his threats into practice.</p>

<p>Setting Mr Cobden aside, we have
still an observation to make. It is
not a little edifying to contrast the
tone assumed at present by the disciples
of the Manchester school with
that which they adopted after the
passing of the disastrous measures
of 1846. We were then entreated,
in Parliament and out of it, to give
the experiment a fair trial. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
admitted that divers extraordinary
occurrences had intervened to postpone
the great advantages to the
nation which must flow from the
opening of the ports, yet still we
were asked to believe that the calculations
of Mr M'Gregor were perfectly
sound, and that in a little time all
would be well. We have waited,
patiently enough, until the last fragment
of agricultural protection has
been removed&mdash;until it is obvious to
every one, save an exporting and
protected manufacturer, that nothing
short of protection can save the landed
interest of Great Britain from total
ruin&mdash;and until ruin, in its worst
shape, has already overtaken Ireland.
And what was it that we waited for?
<span class="smcap">Reciprocity</span>; the sole thing which,
by the acknowledgment of the Peel
party, could justify the experiment.
<span class="smcap">Reciprocity</span>, which Mr Cobden promised
us if we would only show the
example. Now that reciprocity is
out of the question, our antagonists
turn round, revile us as fools for adhering
to our original opinions&mdash;though
the experience of each succeeding
year has attested their accuracy
and soundness&mdash;and, in the contemptible
cant of the day, denominate
their free-trade policy "an accomplished
fact."</p>

<p>They are right in one sense. It is
a fact that this great nation has suffered
itself to be misled by the
machinations of a selfish and unscrupulous
faction. It is also a fact,
that for a time these machinations
have been successful. But the great
fact which now concerns us is, that
the British nation is fully alive to the
imposture; and that being the case,
we entertain not the slightest doubt
as to the ultimate issue.</p>

<p>One word in conclusion to our
friends. It is the policy of those who
are against us&mdash;and indeed their last
desperate chance&mdash;to promote disunion
among the ranks of those who
draw their subsistence from the land,
and whose welfare depends upon the
agricultural prosperity of Britain.
They are trying to set the tenant
against the landlord, the labourer
against the farmer; and their efforts
have been assisted, to no inconsiderable
extent, by the folly of weak men,
who, in their terror, are attempting,
by all the means in their power, to
shelter themselves from the consequences
which they thoroughly
foresee. Our policy, as well as our
duty, is to maintain a firm and
united front. It would be madness
to suppose that among the three
great agricultural classes, there can
be any disunion of interest. Landlord
and farmer depend upon each
other; the one class cannot be prostrated
without the other falling a
victim. And both of them have a
duty to perform to the labourer, which
must not be disregarded. He, as the
lowest in the scale, is often the first
to suffer; but woe to our land if the
labourer should be trodden under
foot!</p>

<p>We repeat that we have no fear for
the future. We see on all hands the
unmistakeable signs of a mighty reaction,
which cannot but defeat the
designs of that grasping faction for
whose benefit alone this ominous experiment
has been made. Deeply as
we deplore the misery which has
overtaken us, we must regard it as
the penalty incurred for having
swerved from the old path by which
Britain attained her greatness&mdash;for
having listened too readily to the
suggestions of selfish and incompetent
men. The experience of each succeeding
month shows the error of the
course we have been pursuing, and
demonstrates the necessity of a return.
Why should we fear? England&mdash;that
noble country which stands pre-eminent
among the nations of the
world for its loyalty, enterprise, and
independence&mdash;for its regard to sterling
worth in the lowest, as well as the
highest sphere&mdash;has awakened from
its momentary trance. The voice of
the people, before which that of faction
must be silenced, is proclaiming,
in clear and articulate language, that
the virtual possession of its free and
unviolated soil shall not be yielded,
through fraud, to the foreigner, who
never could have taken possession of
it by force of arms; and that the
English yeomanry will not submit to
be sacrificed or annihilated for the
wretched interest of a handful of
manufacturers, whose gains are dependent
upon the extension of a foreign
market. We rejoice to see that the
men of England are up and doing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Their energy, if rightly directed,
nothing can withstand. Cobden may
bluster, as demagogues always do;
and Bright may insinuate revolutions
which he has neither the courage nor
the power to attempt; but the day for
such trashy vapouring has gone by,
and England will no longer allow her
greatness to be perilled at the bidding
of such miserable upstarts. The issue
of the late elections, and the triumphant
meetings which are everywhere
held in England, for the maintenance
of her national and agricultural prosperity,
should excite us to similar
efforts. If our statements of what is
occurring here can strengthen the
hands of our brethren in the south, we
shall be more than amply repaid for
the pains we have expended in a close
and laborious investigation. England
may not require support; but support
is ready for her. Ireland, from the
depths of present misery, sees the
hand which is striving to keep her
down, and prepares herself for another
struggle. Scotland will not remain
inactive. Her interest is so clear,
that it would be almost wasting words
to attempt to explain it further.
Let but this experiment go on for a
few years longer, and all that we have
gained, by more than a century of unremitting
toil, will be lost to us: our
improvements will be annihilated,
and our people pauperised. Deprived of
her yeomanry, as noble a body of men
as exists upon the face of the earth, the
nationality of Scotland is gone. We
trust, then, that in every part of the
country the appeal will be energetically
answered. Scotsmen are slow
to move; but being moved, they have
a will and resolution that can bear
down any obstacle whatever. There
never was a time when the old national
spirit was more imperatively
required to show itself than now.
Let us then speak out boldly in defence
of our country, and tell those
Manchester conspirators, in answer
to their insolent challenge, that&mdash;beyond
that circle of smoking factories,
which they falsely imagine to be the
heart of Britain&mdash;there exists a majority
of loyal British subjects, who
despise their dictation, detest their
hypocrisy, and utterly defy their
power.</p>

persons out of employment, including the dependants of those without work. This
number was, doubtless, fearfully great out of a population of 1,200,000 souls. But
it was exceeded in some parts of Great Britain. In April 1848, the number of unemployed
persons in and around Glasgow was so excessive, that an examination of
them was made, by order of the magistrates of that city, with a view to an application
to government for assistance. The men out of work were found, in that city and
its vicinity, to be 31,000, which, allowing two and a half dependants to each male,
implies 93,000 persons destitute of employment, out of a population at that time
estimated at 360,000; being somewhat more than 300,000 out of 1,200,000 in Paris.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> At Sutter's saw-mill, from which the Culloma valley takes its second name, Mr
Johnson saw and conversed with Mr Marshall, a proprietor of the mill, and one of
the first discoverers of the gold. The discovery was made when cutting out the
mill-race, across a portion of the former bed of a stream. "He pointed out to us the
particular location of the first discoveries. This is some fifty yards below the mill,
where a large fir-tree extends across the race. He stated that they threw up a good
deal of gold, mixed with the sand and clay, before they seriously examined it, or
ascertained its character." It must have struck many as singular, that gold mines
so near the surface should so long have been unobserved. California was explored as
far back as the year 1700 by the Jesuit Eusebio Kino, who first ascertained it to be
part of the great American continent, and not an island, as was previously believed:
Soon afterwards, missionary stations were established there, paving the way for the
Spanish conquest of the country. Some of the <em>padres</em> still remain, but their mission-houses
are dilapidated, and their influence is gone. To them Mr Johnson attributes
the long concealment of the metallic wealth of California. "That these priests were
cognisant of the abundance of the precious metal at that period, (a century ago,) is
now well known; but they were members of the extraordinary society of the Jesuits,
which, jealous of its all-pervading influence, and dreading the effect of a large Protestant
emigration to the western, as well as to the eastern shores of America,
applied its powerful injunctions of secrecy to the members of the order; and their
faithful obedience, during so long a period, is another proof both of the strength and
the danger of their organisation."&mdash;<cite>Sights in the Gold Regions</cite>, p. 111.</p></div>

for it was a question of victory or perpetual slavery with them; but their numbers
were limited, their arms indifferent, and altogether the contest seemed too unequal to
last long. It was the first actual fighting in which Howard had been present; but
the imminency of the danger and the sight of conflict appealing to the strong combative
instincts of his race, he fought on deck with the coolness of a Saxon and the
courage of a knight-templar. Indeed, it was his self-possession which proved the
salvation of the crew. There was only one gun of large calibre on board, and of this
he assumed the direction, though he had probably never fired even a rifle in his life;
but, in the hour of peril, fighting seemed to come to him, as to most of his countrymen,
by inspiration. <em>This gun he rammed almost to the muzzle with nails, spikes, and
similar charge, and then, steadily waiting his opportunity, as the privateer bore down
upon them with all her crew on deck, apparently expecting to see the Venetians strike
their flag, he sent the contents in amongst them with such murderous effect</em>, that, after a
moment or two of consternation, the corsairs hoisted sail, and made off at their best

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> It is mentioned by both the chroniclers, Hemingford, (i. 196) and Trivet, (332,) that
Edward the First built "a strength" or fort "at Linlitcu" in 1301, and there enjoyed
the festivities of Christmas. Lord Hailes inaccurately states that he wintered there;
for, by dates since collected from writs, Chalmers has proved that, although Edward
was still at Linlithgow on the 12th January, he was, on his way home, at Roxburgh
on 12th February, and had reached Morpeth by the 24th.
</p>
<p>
This fort, or castle, was probably the same that was, a few years afterwards, taken
by the stratagem of the patriotic yeoman, Binnock, in concealing some of his followers
in a waggon of hay; and who was rewarded by King Robert with an estate, which
his posterity long afterwards enjoyed.</p></div>

its architecture, which a most competent authority, Mr Billings, ("Baronial and Ecclesiastical
Antiquities," vol. i.) has pronounced to be of the purest Norman, it is referred,
at least, to the tenth or eleventh centuries. There is extant a charter of
Waldeve, Earl of Dunbar, from 1166 to 1182, witnessed by the parson of Dumanie.</p></div>

to the Abbey of Dunfermline; the latter in confirmation of a previous grant by Malcolm
Canmore and Queen Margaret, ("Registrum de Dunfermlyn," Imp. Edin. 1842,
p. 5, 6.) A small mausoleum of the Wauchope family now occupies the site of the
chapel of Wymet; and the venerable pile of St Michael the Archangel, at Inneresc,
was ruthlessly demolished in 1804. The house in which the great Randolph died,

Scotland after the death of Harold at Hastings, and in 1072 had extensive lands in
the Merse and Lothian gifted them by Malcolm Canmore. They continued to be one
of the most opulent and powerful houses in the east of Scotland for a considerable
period, as evidenced by their donations, noted in the chartularies of Coldingham,
Newbottle, Dryburgh, Kelso, Melrose, and Soltra. Founded on a steep rugged rock,
within sea-mark, and communicating with the land through a covered passage, the
castle of Dunbar might well, before the invention of gunpowder, have been deemed
impregnable. It was often the theatre of warlike contention, and two great battles
were fought in its immediate neighbourhood,&mdash;the first in 1296, when Earl Warenne
defeated the army of Scotland sent for its relief; and the second in 1650, when
Leslie was overthrown by Cromwell. It was often besieged, and as often bravely
defended; but perhaps never so brilliantly as by Black Agnes against the Earl of
Salisbury in 1337.</p></div>

that he had deducted rather too small a quantity of oats and barley for seed, according to the
average usual in the district. Any alteration which this involves would be a deduction from
the tenant's original profit, and an addition to the amount of loss already brought out.
</p>
<p>
Mr Dudgeon also says&mdash;"I omit at present adding to this deficit the depreciation which
it may be further estimated will result permanently from the open trade in live stock and
cured provisions. But it may be stated that the recent depression in the value of stock from
that of late seasons, amounting to <em>at least</em> 15 per cent, shows a farther present loss on the
